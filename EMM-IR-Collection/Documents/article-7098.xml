  <text>Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem informed Russia in talks on Tuesday that some Syrian troops deployed in the protest city of Homs have been pulled back in line with the Kofi Annan peace plan, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
"The minister informed [us] that some of the Syrian government troops have been pulled out of Homs to their permanent base," it said in a statement.
"The Russian side applauded these actions and called on Damascus to make further steps to implement the Kofi Annan plan."
After talks between Mouallem and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the ministry said Moscow welcomed what it described as the Syrian leadership's "readiness" for constructive cooperation with Annan.
It said Russia "highly appreciated" Syria's decision to take the first step and withdraw troops and heavy weaponry from major cities in line with Annan's six-point initiative.
Implementing the plan demands "clear action" from both sides in the conflict and requires that the opposition "did its bit" by ensuring the implementation of a stable ceasefire within 48 hours, the ministry said.
