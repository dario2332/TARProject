  <text>Witnesses described how the attackers set on them at dawn using rocks, clubs, firebombs and firing shotguns.
The army says it has now deployed soldiers to prevent further clashes.
The two leading Islamist candidates for the presidency earlier suspended their campaigns in protest at the way the authorities handled the demonstration.
In addition, the FJP and the Salafist Nour party, which together control 70% of the seats in parliament, decided to boycott a meeting with the ruling Supreme Council of Armed Forces (Scaf).
Many of the protesters were supporters of a Salafist preacher barred from standing in the presidential election.
Hazem Abu Ismail was disqualified because his mother had dual Egyptian-US nationality, violating rules laid out in a constitutional declaration approved after an uprising forced President Hosni Mubarak to step down.
The attack on demonstrators outside the Egyptian defence ministry follows what has become a familiar pattern in recent months.
The attackers were unidentified thugs in plain clothes. Egyptians will strongly suspect they were, at the very least, encouraged by some section of the government.
The attack is most unlikely to deter the protesters. More likely, the demonstrators will summon reinforcements, with the danger of further clashes in coming days.
The first round of the presidential election is just three weeks away. Despite the violence, and the disqualification of several leading candidates, at the moment the vote does not appear to be under threat.
Mr Abu Ismail complained that he was the victim of a "plot" by the military authorities, but the election commission said it had found no evidence.
The assailants have now set up checkpoints to stop more protesters arriving at the scene, our correspondent adds.
Soldiers and police deployed in the area earlier reportedly did not intervene to stop the clashes, nor did they when one person was killed in a similar attack early on Sunday.
The council has been accused of stifling dissent by killing protesters, detaining critics and seeking to undermine the youth and civil society groups which led the uprising.
The generals have promised to hand over power to a civilian administration by the end of June, after a presidential election that they say will be free and fair.
The race seems to have narrowed to a contest between Mr Aboul Fotouh, Mr Mursi, and the former head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa.
