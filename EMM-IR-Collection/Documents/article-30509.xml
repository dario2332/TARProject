  <text>Syrian president Bashar Assad

Activists have raised the number of those reportedly killed by regime forces in a district of central Syria to more than 90.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said today that more than 90 people had been killed in the Houla area in the last 24 hours.
A local activist giving his name as Abu Yazan said 12 people died in shelling and 106 were killed when pro-regime thugs known as shabiha stormed the area.
That death toll is one of the highest for any single event since the popular uprising against Bashar Assad began in March 2011. The UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians.
The UN said today a team of observers was heading to the area.
