The biggest coordinated attack on the Afghan capital in 10 years of war has shaken a vulnerable nation facing the withdrawal of a huge force of NATO troops within two years.
President Hamid Karzai said Sunday's assault showed an intelligence failure on the part of both Afghan and -- "especially" -- NATO forces and called for an investigation.
Karzai, like NATO, praised the rapid response by Afghan security forces, saying it "proved to the people that they can defend their country successfully".
But his laying of the major share of the blame on troops whose home countries are already tired of the long war and its enormous cost, is unlikely to go down well with his allies.
For 18 hours, squads of Taliban militants who had infiltrated the capital and taken up strategic positions in three locations fired on government buildings, embassies and foreign military bases before all 15 were killed.
A total of 51 people died, including 36 militants, and some 74 were wounded in Kabul and three neighbouring provinces where government and military targets also came under synchronised attack, the government says.
"That they did manage to pull off simultaneous complex attacks shows quite a level of sophistication in preventing detection... so that would be a failure in intelligence," said Martine van Bijlert of the Afghanistan Analysts' Network.
"But having said that, in a big bustling city like Kabul it is incredibly difficult to stop this type of attack," she said.
NATO, which is committed to pulling its 130,000 troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 whatever happens militarily, was naturally looking for the positives out of the attack.
"I am enormously proud of how quickly Afghan security forces responded to (the) attacks in Kabul," said General John Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
His praise was echoed by US ambassador Ryan Crocker, who said the ability of Afghan security forces to respond to the attacks was a "clear sign of progress".
But a Western diplomat with security expertise told AFP: "I don't share at all the optimism of NATO or the Americans: the Afghan forces just reacted to several attacks as they are in charge and did their duty, at the end with the help of American Black Hawks.
"It's true that they did it better than in the past -- there is progress but still, to build up so many attacks and being able to launch them simultaneously demonstrates clearly (the Taliban's) ability to strike where and when they want," he said on condition of anonymity.
For Afghans themselves the assault was not unexpected but was "shocking in terms of the scale of the attack and in terms of being very well-coordinated in different cities simultaneously," said Abdul Waheed Wafa, director of the Afghanistan Center at Kabul University.
"It shook the confidence of the Afghan people in their national security forces, especially as they were hearing from the foreign forces and their government over the last couple of months that the Taliban had 'lost their momentum'," he told AFP.
Karzai said in a statement that "the terrorists' infiltration in Kabul and other provinces is an intelligence failure for us and especially for NATO and should be seriously investigated".
ISAF has dismissed the Kabul attacks as "largely ineffective" and it is a fact that no major damage or casualties were inflicted on the main targets -- embassies, military bases and government institutions.
But the Taliban, which claimed the attacks as the start of their annual spring offensive marking the beginning of the Afghan fighting season, will relish the propaganda victory of penetrating Kabul's "Ring of Steel".
"I think the attacks were specifically designed to capture headlines. They were not designed to result in maximum casualties or maximum damage," said Van Bijlert.
"So they really managed in creating an impression of Kabul under siege, with relatively limited means. What it illustrates is how this is very much a war of perceptions and also how the Taliban understands that very well."
The insurgents had used "a pure guerilla tactic, which shows their will and determination to strike symbolic targets, to get the maximum impact in the media," said a second Western diplomat, describing the attacks as a "very ill omen for the future".
