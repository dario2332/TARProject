  <text>The United Nations nuclear watchdog has opened a third round of talks with Iran over its disputed nuclear programme by pressing Tehran to grant inspectors access to key sites.
The two-day meeting in Vienna comes despite previous refusals to allow entry to the Parchin military base, which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) believes could be a centre for nuclear weapons research.
An IAEA report cited foreign intelligence that suggested that the Parchin facility had been used to conduct explosives tests in what they think was a pressure chamber.
In recent weeks, the US and Israel have stepped up the pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme which Tehran says is being developed for peaceful purposes.  Washington has refused to rule out a military strike.
Iran is also set for wider talks with several nuclear powers in Baghdad next week.
