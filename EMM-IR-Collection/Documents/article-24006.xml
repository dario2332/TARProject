  <text>Future bloc MP Hadi Hobeich told MTV on Sunday that there was a lot of tension in Akkar following the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahid.“There is a lot of tension in [Akkar], and the area’s [officials] and MPs are making efforts to calm people down,” Hobeich said.
He added that it was “unacceptable” no matter what the circumstances were to open fire toward Abdel Wahid and kill him and his bodyguard.
The NNA reported earlier on Sunday that an “armed convoy” carrying Abdel Wahid to the northern Lebanese town of Halba refused to stop at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Akkar.
According to the report, the Lebanese army opened fire when the convoy failed to stop, which led to the death of Abdel Wahid and a bodyguard identified as Mohammad Hussein Merheb, both from the town of Al-Beri.
