The hard-won truce to end a 13-month crackdown on dissent that has cost an estimated more than 10,000 lives appeared to be holding, but French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he did not expect it to last. He questioned President Bashar al Assad's sincerity and appealed for observers to monitor his compliance.
UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan, who brokered the cease-fire, urged Syria to open humanitarian corridors to deliver aid.
"Mr. Annan is aware that we don't have a perfect situation in the country at the moment," according to his spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi. "There are detainees that need to be released. Humanitarian corridors need to be opened."
Protesters rallied in the Qadam and Assali districts of Damascus, while other demonstrations took place in Irbin and Bibla outside the capital, according to videos posted online.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said demonstrations were organized in the northern province of Aleppo, while protesters took to the streets after the main weekly Muslim prayers in several neighborhoods of Deir Ezzor in the east.
The Britain-based watchdog said demonstrators hurled stones at security forces in the Tariq al Sadd district of the southern city of Daraa, the cradle of the protest movement that erupted in March last year.
Sporadic clashes broke out between troops and rebels at Khirbet al Joz on the northern border with Turkey, it said.
Violence yesterday killed at least 10 people, including seven civilians, and wounded dozens more.
The toll was markedly lower than in recent weeks, when there often were dozens of people killed on a daily basis.
Today, security forces killed one man when they opened fire at a group joining a demonstration in Assi Square, in Hama, the Observatory said.
Another demonstrator was shot dead in the village of Nawa, in Daraa Province, as he left a mosque to join a demonstration, the Observatory added.
Regime forces also killed a man in the town of Salqin, in Idlib Province, it added.
The Annan plan, to which Damascus committed itself, calls for the withdrawal of forces from urban areas, the release of arbitrarily detained people, freedom of movement for journalists and the right to demonstrate.
Despite the regime's commitment, the spokeswoman for the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC), Basma Qoudmani, said that "we have concrete proof that heavy weapons are still in population centers."
The SNC, the most widely recognized opposition group in exile, and internet-based activists called for peaceful demonstrations to test the government's readiness to accept public shows of dissent.
Also today, the UN Security Council could vote on a resolution authorizing the deployment of observers to monitor both sides in the conflict.
An advance mission of 20 to 30 observers could be in place early next week, diplomats said, with the full mission reaching at least 200.
