  <text>AFP - A UN panel said Thursday the army was to blame for most rights abuses in the latest violence that has swept Syria, as a watchdog reported renewed military shelling of a rebel bastion.
Syria's main opposition bloc began searching for a new leader after Paris-based academic Burhan Ghalioun formally resigned, meanwhile, as the regime said parliament convened for the first time since elections.
In Geneva, the UN-apppointed Commission of Inquiry on Syria said the army and security forces were responsible for the majority of the serious abuses committed since March this year as they hunt down defectors and opponents.
"Most of the serious human rights violations documented by the Commission in this update were committed by the Syrian army and security services as part of military or search operations conducted in locations known for hosting defectors and/or armed persons, or perceived as supportive of anti-government armed groups," said the pane.
These violations were committed "as part of military or search operations conducted in locations known for hosting defectors and/or armed persons, or perceived as supportive of anti-government armed groups," it said.
The panel said "a clear pattern" had emerged of government blockades to "weed out" wanted people and their families, causing children to die for lack of adequate health care.
The report was issued as government forces pounded the rebel stronghold of Rastan for an 11th consecutive day, killing at least three civilians, according the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Violence elsewhere killed 10 other people, including eight people who were summarily executed in northwestern Idlib province, the Britain-based watchdog reported.
Government forces have been trying to overrun Rastan since May 14, when rebel fighters from the battered central city of Homs regrouped in the town that straddles the main highway linking Damascus to the north.
Speaking to AFP via Skype on Wednesday, Abu Rawan, an opposition activist in Rastan, said there was no electricity in the besieged town, and a shortage of food and water.
Abu Rawan was not reachable for comment on Thursday morning.
Elsewhere in the country, one civilian and regular army soldier were killed in eastern Deir Ezzor province, according to the Observatory.
"Regime forces killed a young man at dawn in Quriya town in Deir Ezzor," it said, adding clashes between rebel forces and regime troops were taking place in the town, leaving dead one soldier.
More than 12,600 people have been killed in Syria since a revolt against President Bashar al-Assad's rule broke out in March 2011, including nearly 1,500 since a UN-backed truce took effect on April 12, says the Observatory.
On the political front, Ghalioun formally resigned late Wednesday as the chairman of the Syrian National Council, an exile group which some Western and Arab states have recognised as a "legitimate representative" of Syria's people.
The SNC "office decided to accept the resignation and to ask the council president to pursue his work until the election of a new president at a meeting on June 9-10", it said in a statement announcing his resignation.
The statement also said Syria's unwillingness to stick to a peace deal brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan and the ongoing shelling and killing in the country were "a deliberate attempt to scupper the plan".
It called on "the international community to immediately act to adopt a new mechanism, through the (UN) Security Council, to force the Syrian regime to put an end to its crimes because as it is this regime only reacts to force".
Ghalioun had announced plans to step aside on May 17 to avert divisions within the opposition bloc, after activists inside Syria accused him of monopolising power.
Meanwhile, SANA state news agency said Syria's 250-seat parliament on Thursday started its first meeting since May 7 elections in order to elect a speaker and swear in deputies, all but 41 of them new.
SANA said that turnout in the election reached 51.26 percent out of 5,186,957 eligible voters, and that 30 women were elected to the People's Assembly.
It added that the new members of parliament represented "all spectrums of society," although it did not specify.
The regime of President Assad, whose Baath party has ruled Syria unchallenged for decades, touted the elections as the first in a newly approved multi-party system.
But the opposition says they boycotted both the election and a constitutional referendum, and the United States and other Western nations described them as a farce.
