A woman has been arrested in connection with the murder of Ciaran Noonan.
The woman, 24, was detained in Dublin and taken to Store Street Garda station.
She is being held and questioned under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.
It is the eighth arrest over the killing of the 29-year-old father of one, whose body was found on farmland in Co Meath earlier this month. No one has yet been charged.
Mr Noonan, who it is believed owed a drug debt, was kidnapped from the East Wall area of Dublin on October 20.
He was murdered before being dumped in a field at Tullaghmeaden, about six miles outside Trim, Co Meath.
His body was not discovered until November 4 after a tip-off.
