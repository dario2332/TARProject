  <text>At least two people have been killed and 18 injured in clashes overnight in the Lebanese capital Beirut.
The clashes, between Sunni pro- and anti-Syrian groups, followed the shooting dead on Sunday of two anti-Syrian sheikhs.
The violence is the first in Beirut since the conflict began in neighbouring Syria in March last year.
It follows a week of clashes in the northern city of Tripoli between anti-Syrian Sunnis and Alawites who support the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Supporters of Mr Hariri responded by blocking main roads with burning car tyres, but security forces intervened to clear them.
Rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire were heard for much of the night.
But the clashes died away after the leader, Shaker Berjawi, left the area, and the Lebanese Army moved in.
Sunni religious and political leaders have called for the utmost restraint, and an investigation has been launched into the killing of the two sheikhs.
Correspondents say there are fears of a return to the violence seen in clashes between Sunni and Shia Muslims in 2008 which brought the country close to civil war.
