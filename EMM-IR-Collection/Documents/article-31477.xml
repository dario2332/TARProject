Angry protests over the killings of civilians Friday in Houla continued across parts of Syria on Sunday, including the capital Damascus, where security forces fired on protesters in the Midan district.
He claimed that his version of what took place is fact and not hypothesis, saying hundreds of heavily armed men attacked government troops, confined to five defensive positions.  Those troops, he argues, did not leave their positions except to defend themselves during a nine-hour attack, as armed men allegedly burned houses and killed civilians.
Arab satellite channels showed an amateur video of a resident of that village, Teldau, meeting with a U.N. observer team and complaining about the cruel behavior of government forces. "My God, we are men," he said, "we are men and they are killing us as if we were less than donkeys. We were created by God. Can it be that they are not God-fearing men?"
Khattar Abou Diab, who teaches political science at the University of Paris, says the Syrian government has a long history of using brutality and repression to deal with opposition.
He argued the government has a bad habit of using brutal force to put down rebellions, such as the one in Hama in 1982, which killed thousands of people, as well as brutality against prisoners.  He adds the Assad government has done everything possible to militarize the current conflict and turn it into a sectarian affair in order to remain in power.
The acting head of the opposition Syrian National Council, Burhan Ghalyoun, urged the international community to "assume its responsibilities in protecting the Syrian people," or face the prospect of a widening war to liberate the country.
