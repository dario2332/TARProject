  <text>Justice Minister Shakib Qortbawi voiced concern on Wednesday over the reports concerning the abduction of Lebanese nationals in Syria.
“The kidnapping of the Lebanese pilgrims in Syria [while on their way back from Iran] is a dangerous [incident],” Qortbawi told Voice of Lebanon (100.5) radio station.
The minister, however, commended the “very responsible” reaction of Hezbollah and the Amal Movement “which contributed to wading off the deterioration of the situation on the internal Lebanese scene.”
Earlier on Tuesday, 13 Lebanese Shia Muslims were kidnapped in Aleppo province as they were headed back home by bus from a pilgrimage in Iran. Their families said that they were abducted by Syrian rebels. The Free Syrian Army, however, denied the accusation.
Qortbawi called on the Lebanese to “learn from the lessons of the past,” adding, “what is needed is maintaining [the country’s] stability but not calling for the withdrawal of the [Lebanese] army,” in a reference to the calls for the withdrawal of the LAF from the North following the sectarian clashes that gripped Tripoli and its surroundings.
Clashes and protests in the Lebanese northern city of Tripoli followed the arrest of Lebanese citizen Shadi al-Mawlawi earlier in May by General Security at a social services center belonging Finance Minister Mohammad Safadi.
The security situation further deteriorated on Sunday when army troops shot dead a Sunni cleric when his convoy allegedly failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon.
