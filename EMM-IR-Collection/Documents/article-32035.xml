Speaking during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, foreign 
  secretary William Hague said Russia and Britain agreed Kofi Annan's peace 
  plan was "at the moment the only hope" for resolving Syria's 
  crisis and that Russia had an important role to play.
Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was deeply alarmed by the 
  massacre in the Syrian town of Houla, but added it was clear both President 
  Bashar al-Assad's government and rebels were to blame.
"We are dealing with a situation in which both sides evidently had a hand in 
  the deaths of innocent people," Lavrov said.
Lavrov said he and Hague agreed both the government and its foes must be 
  pressured to end violence, and the Russian foreign minister criticised 
  nations he said argued that there could be no solution without Assad's exit
