The 70-nation Friends of Syria has recognized the Syrian National Council as the "legitimate representative" of all Syrians, the conference's final statement says. The meeting also brought pledged support for the implementation of Annan`s peace plan.
Calls to arm the Syrian rebels are growing louder, with Saudi Arabia saying that supplying weapons is a “duty.” The desire to tool up rebels comes as major Syrian opposition groups have appealed to neighboring states to allow the transit of arms.
The Syrian government has said that it will not withdraw its troops from towns and cities across the conflict-torn country until “peace and security prevail.” Officials maintain that security forces are there to uphold security and protect civilians.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has proposed improved collaboration with Gulf Arab states on maritime security and missile defense to counter potential threats from Iran.

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are creating a multimillion-dollar fund to bankroll the Syrian rebels battling President Assad’s regime.
Attendants at the weekend’s Friends of Syria conference confirmed to AP that plans were afoot to fund the fighting.
Turkey’s foreign minister told the meeting, convened to raise funds for  regime change in Syria, that the meeting supported the covenant of the  Syrian national council as a legitimate representative of  "all Syrians”.
The Turkey-based Syrian National Council will use the slush fund to pay salaries of Free Syrian Army soldiers and defectors from the Syrian armed forces.
“The SNC will take charge of the payment of fixed salaries of all officers, soldiers, and others who are members of the Free Syrian Army,” Council head Burhan Ghalioun said.
One of the officials called the fund a “pot of gold” to undermine President Bashar Assad's army.
The United States has also announced additional American “aid to the Syrian people” that will bring the total to $12 million. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US would provide communications equipment to the rebels.
The meeting gathered more than 70 representatives of Arab and Western countries who support the Syrian opposition in its fight against President Assad’s regime.
Earlier, Saudi Arabia called on the Friends of Syria to arm the rebels, saying supplying weapons is a “duty”. However, most of the conference participants are not ready to provide anything beyond non-lethal aid.
Journalist and political analyst Christoph Hoerstel told RT that salaries for the rebels are not news, as they “have been paid since the beginning.”
He insists that the conflict in Syria had been planned in advance from as early as summer 2010, and that this information “kills the whole story the West and some of those corrupt allies… are making out of Syria.”
Rallies following the Duma and Presidential elections saw tens of thousands brandish banners and pour into the streets. But some are sick and tired of all the hype - so much so, that they've decided to protest against it.
An Israeli strike against Iran would have “disastrous” consequences for the entire region, says Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Earlier, Israel spoke of a three-month deadline for Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions.
Well now everybody can clearly see who the real sponsors and the creators of terrorism are. They did it with their arch player Bin Laden in Afghanistan, then brought him in Bosnia where was wounded in his leg – sworn enemy of socialism, and again S Arabia did the funding. Suggestions as well they were also behind the 9/11. Then Libya and now Syria. Finally cards on the table and masks down for the global Zionists team.
