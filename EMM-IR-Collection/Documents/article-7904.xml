  <text>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — International envoy Kofi Annan has appealed to Syria's key ally Iran to support his plan to end the violence wracking the Arab country, saying that "any further militarization of the conflict would be disastrous."
Annan spoke to reporters after talks on Tuesday with Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi.
The U.N.-Arab League envoy has been pushing Damascus to withdraw its troops from cities and halt all violence in 48 hours to salvage his peace plan.
Annan said in Tehran that he and his host agreed on the need to "find a peaceful solution to the crisis" and he voiced optimism that the situation on the ground would improve by Thursday morning.
Salehi insisted that "change in Syria" should come under the leadership of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
