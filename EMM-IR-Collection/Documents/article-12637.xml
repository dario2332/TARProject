Afghanistan's Taliban has condemned photographs of US soldiers posing with the remains of their militants, calling the images "inhuman" and vowing revenge.
The photos were taken two years ago but were published by the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday.
In one, a US soldier poses with an insurgent's corpse - the dead man's hand rests on the soldier's shoulder.
Another photograph shows several soldiers next to Afghan police. They are grinning while some hold a corpse's severed legs as others squat beside the body.
The Taliban "strongly condemns the brutal and inhuman act by the American invading force and their uncultured slaves", it said in a statement.
The militant group, which has waged a brutal insurgency since being ousted from power in late 2001, said they would avenge the dead militants.
"This is what the invading Americans teach to their Afghan slaves," the statement said, referring to the members of the Afghan security forces trained and funded by the US-led troops.
US defence secretary Leon Panetta earlier said those responsible would be punished.
"This is not who we are and it's certainly not who we represent when it comes to the great majority of men and women in uniform who are serving there," he said.
He also voiced "regret" that the LA Times published the images against his wishes, warning that they could prompt a violent backlash.
"War is ugly and it's violent and I know that young people sometimes caught up in the moment make some very foolish decisions," he said.
"I am not excusing that, but neither do I want these images to bring further injury to our people or to our relationship with the Afghan people.
"We had urged the LA Times not to run those photos and the reason for that is those kinds of photos are used by the enemy."
The LA Times published two of 18 photographs it was given by a soldier who believed they pointed to a breakdown in leadership and discipline that compromised the safety of the troops.
The soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were on assignments when the photos were taken.
This embarrassing incident is another in a string that has tested the US-Afghan relationship.
In January a video appeared of US troops urinating on dead Afghans, then in February the accidental burning of Korans by American soldiers triggered riots that left dozens dead, and last month a sergeant allegedly killed 17 Afghan civilians in a night-time rampage.
