  <text>The deeply unpopular 56-year-old president has a long-standing heart condition and his admittance to hospital sparked fevered speculation in the media and on microblogging site Twitter that he may step down.
As a figurehead president in a country where power is deemed to lie with the military, he is also away as Pakistan battles perhaps its worst crisis in US relations after NATO air strikes killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on November 26.
Aides have so far been unable to say when he will return home, after one member of the cabinet initially said he would go back to Islamabad on Thursday.
"It depends on the doctors, when he will be discharged. They will tell after receiving results of some more tests," Babar added.
Mustafa Khokhar, an adviser to the prime minister on human rights, told AFP that Zardari suffered a "minor heart attack" and underwent an angioplasty.
Petroleum Minister Asim Hussain told Geo TV that he was being kept in intensive care, but only as a means of keeping visitors to a minimum.
Babar said the reports were "speculative, imaginary and untrue".
The Foreign Policy article quoted an unnamed former US government official as saying Zardari was "incoherent" when he spoke to President Barack Obama by telephone over the weekend and that he was feeling under increased pressure.
"The noose was getting tighter -- it was only a matter of time," the former official said, in what Foreign Policy called "growing expectation inside the US government that Zardari may be on the way out".
Although Zardari has survived numerous crises and calls for his resignation, he is under huge pressure over a memo allegedly written by close aide Husain Haqqani asking for American assistance in curbing the powerful military.
The memo sent in May to the then US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, sought help over fears of a military coup following the secret US raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2.
In June, US pollsters Pew Research Center gave Zardari an approval rating in Pakistan of only 11 percent.
