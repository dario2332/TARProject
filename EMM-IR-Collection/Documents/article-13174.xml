At least six people were killed in an early morning suicide attack in the Afghan capital, hours after a surprise visit to Afghanistan by President Barack Obama, government officials said.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was a response to Mr Obama’s visit.
A series of explosions and gunfire rang out in eastern Kabul at around 6am near a private armed compound that houses hundreds of international workers.
Shooting continued for hours and it was not clear later whether the attack was finished, as another large explosion sounded around 8am from inside the complex - known as Green Village.
An Afghan police official said two suicide attackers were still inside Green Village and were “resisting”.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release the information.
One of the first blasts was a suicide car bomb that exploded near Jalalabad road – one of the main thoroughfares out of the city, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi.
A station wagon that was driving past was caught up in the explosion and four people inside were killed, Mr Sediqi said.
A passer-by and a security guard for a nearby building also were killed.
The explosions happened hours after Mr Obama left Afghanistan after a quick visit to mark the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden’s death.
He spoke to troops and signed a pact with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to govern the US presence in Afghanistan through to 2024.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was planned as a response to Mr Obama’s trip.
“This is a reaction to Obama’s visit to Afghanistan,” Mr Mujahid said, without elaborating. He said the target was a “foreign military base”.
Nato forces spokesman Captain Justin Brockhoff said there were no indications that any Nato bases were under attack.
The Green Village complex, with its towering blast walls and heavily armed security force, is very similar in appearance to Nato bases in the city.
A reporter at the scene saw a group of Afghan soldiers enter the Green Village compound, after which heavy shooting could be heard coming from inside.
Outside the complex, men could be seen carrying a wounded man covered with blood, apparently pulled out of the flames engulfing a nearby car.
“These people evacuated a man from the burning car, two bodies are laying there now and three or four other victims were evacuated from the school,” said Ahmad Zia, a resident who saw the explosion.
Green Village was also the target of anti-foreigner protests following the burning of Korans at a US base in February. At that time, violent protests raged outside, but the angry crowds did not breach the compound’s defences.
