The UN and Arab League envoy to Syria Kofi Annan arrived Monday in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and representatives of the opposition. He said he was "horrified" by the killing in the town Houla where a hundred of people were killed last Friday.
"I am personally shocked and horrified by the tragic events two days ago," said Annan told the press upon his arrival in Damascus, referring to the massacre perpetrated in this central Syria twon, where a hundred of people, including fifty children died Friday.
" The envoy arrived in Damascus today for talks with President Bashar al-Assad and senior officials, "said Ahmad Fawzi, a spokesman for Annan. He will also meet "with representatives of the opposition and civil society "and General Robert Mood, the chief of UN observer mission in Syria.
This visit to Syria, is Annan's second since his appointment as envoy three months ago, came a day after a condemnation of the Syrian regime by the UN Security Council. In a declaration adopted unanimously at the conclusion of an emergency meeting in New York, the 15 member countries have denounced " a series of bombardments by government tanks and artillery against a residential area "of Houla.
Annan, appointed February 23, paid a first visit to Syria on March 10, after which he declared a cease fire, which came into force on April 12 but violated daily.
