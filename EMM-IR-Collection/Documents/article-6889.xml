  <text>Syria finds itself increasingly isolated, as the deadline passes for the country to halt the violence and meet the terms of the ceasefire agreed to by President Bashar al-Assad.
The country's main opposition group says 1,000 people have been killed by government forces in the last eight days. A spokeswoman for the Syrian National Council says troops loyal to Assad have intensified their onslaught in opposition areas. SNC spokeswoman Bassma Kodmani says 160 people were killed in Syria on Monday alone.
Kodmani told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that regime forces have used heavy weapons including anti-aircraft guns against civilians. She says the humanitarian situation is "dramatically deteriorating"
Military forces were supposed to withdraw from towns and villages on Tuesday with both sides ceasing all hostilities by 6 a.m. Thursday.
Speaking in Moscow, Syria's foreign minister claimed opposition forces are violating the ceasefire. Russia and other key Syria allies, however, are clearly running out of patience, CBC Middle East correspondent Derek Stoffel reported.
"Bashar al-Assad has once again thumbed his nose at the international community," Stoffel said. "By now his troops and heavy artillery were supposed to be pulling out of residential areas across Syria. Instead this morning, Assad's forces continued to hit Homs, the city that has seen by far the most violence."
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said Tuesday the government has already withdrawn some forces from some Syrian cities and that the UN-brokered ceasefire must start simultaneously with the deployment of the international observer mission.
"We have already withdrawn forces and army units from several Syrian provinces," Muallem said, following talks in Moscow with his Russian counterpart.
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero dismissed Syria's claims of compliance as "a new expression of this flagrant and unacceptable lie."
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said there were no indications the Syrian regime was pulling back forces. Instead, the group and activists in Syria reported shelling attacks and raids in several locations in the north, centre and south of the country, it said.
"Soldiers are not being withdrawn from towns and villages," said Fadi al-Yassin, an activist in the Idlib province close to Turkey. "On the contrary, reinforcements are being sent."
Besides Russia, Syria's other major ally, China, said Tuesday it hoped the country would adhere to the peace plan.
"We hope that the Syrian government, opposition groups and other relevant parties concerned immediately and effectively respond to special envoy Annan's mediation plan, and hear the calls of the international community for a pragmatic commitment to abide by the promise of ceasefire and troop withdrawal," Reuters quoted a spokesman as saying.
Russia called on the Syrian opposition Tuesday — as well as countries that "influence them" — to use their powers to bring about the ceasefire.
"We would like to call on all opposition leaders and all countries that have influence on the political and military opposition to use their influence to bring about an immediate ceasefire as is provided by Kofi Annan's plan," said Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Lavrov also said after the meeting with Muallem that Syria's government "could have been more active and decisive" in implementing the peace plan.
On Sunday, the Assad regime imposed new last-minute conditions that threw Annan's peace-plan deal into disarray, Stoffel reported.
"Annan isn't giving up though. He's in Turkey visiting Syrian refugees before heading to Iran, Syria's last regional ally, in an effort to increase the pressure on President Assad."
Annan arrived in Turkey on Tuesday to visit a Syrian refugee camp the day after Syrian troops fired across two borders wounding at least five people, killing one Lebanese cameraman, and forcing the Turkish foreign minister to cut short his visit to China.
