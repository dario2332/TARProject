  <text>The Afghan capital Kabul has come under co-ordinated attack, with explosions and gunfire rocking the diplomatic enclave as gunmen took over a hotel and tried to enter parliament.
Suicide bombers had taken over the newly-built Kabul Star hotel, which was reportedly on fire in an area which includes a major US military base, the United Nations office and the presidential palace, witnesses said on Sunday.
The Taliban said they and other armed groups were behind the co-ordinated attacks in the Afghan capital, which included attacks on the British and German embassies in the heavily guarded, central diplomatic district.
"We claim responsibility for these attacks," Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban spokesman, said.
Taliban fighers had also launched assaults in two provinces, the spokesman for the armed group said.
There was no report of casualties, as the area was sealed off by security forces.
In another incident, gunmen entered government buildings in Logar province, south of Kabul, officials said.
The locations under attack included the offices of the provincial governor, police headquarters, a US base - all close to each other, deputy provincial police chief, Raees Khan told AFP.
Attackers fired a rocket-propelled grenade into a house used by British diplomats in the city centre and smoke billowed from the building after the blast, a Reuters news agency quoted a witness as saying.
Two rockets hit a British Embassy guard tower near the Reuters office in the city.
Several other attackers tried to enter the Afghan parliament but were engaged by security forces and driven back, an official said.
They had taken cover in a building near the parliament and fighting was ongoing, parliamentary media officer Qudratullah Jawid told AFP news agency.
US army convoys could be seen coming to the area accompanied by Afghan police in flak jackets.
As the attacks began, several large explosions and bursts of gunfire were heard near the US embassy.
The embassy sounded alarms and warned staff to take cover, AFP reporters heard from their office near the embassy in the Wazir Akbar Khan area, which houses many diplomatic missions.
