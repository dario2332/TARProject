  <text>Salafi Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir said on Sunday that followers of the Syrian regime killed Sunni Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed.
“The followers of the Syrian regime killed Abdel Wahed. These followers are the ones trying to dominate Lebanon and some of its security bodies, and they are the ones who incited strife in Tripoli by detaining [Lebanese citizen] Shadi al-Mawlawi as a favor to the Syrian regime,” Assir said in a statement.
He also condemned the murder of Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, and called on Tripoli and Akkar residents to be careful of what was being planned for their areas.
Army troops shot dead Abdel Wahed, on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed.-NOW Lebanon
