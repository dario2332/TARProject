  <text>Syria has captured foreign mercenaries accused of fighting for the opposition and is ready to show them to the world, President Bashar Assad said during his first interview in nearly half a year, broadcast Wednesday.
Assad also denounced the opposition Syrian National Council as both ineffective and working against their own people's interests and complained that Western countries protest the violence by his regime's forces but not by the opposition fighters.
Assad said the Syrian National Council's call to boycott parliamentary elections this year discredited the group.
"To call for boycotting the elections, that's the equivalent of calling for a boycott of the people," Assad said in the interview, which was broadcast on Russian state news channel Rossiya-24.
"And how can you boycott the people of whom you consider yourself the representative?
"So I don't think that they have any kind of weight or significance within Syria," Assad said in remarks translated into Russian.
Assad also said religious extremists and al-Qaeda members from abroad are among the forces fighting his government.
"There are foreign mercenaries, some of them still alive. They are being detained and we are preparing to show them to the world," he said.
The Assad regime's crackdown on a 14-month-long popular uprising has left thousands dead and has prompted international condemnation.
The Syrian uprising began in March 2011 with mostly peaceful protests calling for change, but a relentless government crackdown led many in the opposition to take up arms. Some soldiers also have switched sides and joined forces with the rebels.
World powers have backed a peace plan that was put forward by Annan, but the bloodshed has not stopped. More than 200 UN observers have been deployed in Syria to oversee the truce between the government and armed rebels.
The UN estimates the conflict has killed more than 9,000 people.
UN spokesman Hassan Seklawi said 211 military observers as well as 66 civilian UN staffers working for the observation mission have been deployed in the country, with teams based in major cities such as Aleppo, Hama, Idlib, Deir el-Zour, Daraa and Homs.
Syria's UN ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, has said that deadly bombings last week in Damascus were evidence of "terrorist activities" by "groups and organizations affiliated with al-Qaeda."
He also claimed Syria has a list of "12 foreign terrorists" killed in Syria, including one French citizen, one British citizen and one Belgian citizen, and he offered the list to the 15 members of the UN Security Council.
Kofi Annan, the UN and Arab League envoy to Syria, is expected to visit Syria this month, Assad said.
He added that he intends to complain to Annan about one-sided criticism of Syria.
The West "talks about violence, but violence from the side of the government, not a word about terrorists. We are waiting for this, as we have before. Mr. Annan will come to Syria this month, and I will ask him about this matter," the Syrian leader said.
