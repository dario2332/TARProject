  <text>DAMASCUS: Syria showed no let up in assaults on protest hubs Wednesday as peace envoy Kofi Annan said there was still a chance to salvage a peace plan for a complete halt to hostilities within 24 hours.
Shells and rockets were fired into Khaldiyeh, a stronghold for regime opponents who have taken up arms, as well as other parts of the flashpoint city of Homs, in central Syria, the LCC reported.
On the northern border, shots fired by Syrian forces struck a Syrian refugee camp inside Turkey early Wednesday, Turkish media reported, two days after shooting from Syria wounded four Syrians and two Turks on Turkish soil.
The government in Damascus had given "further clarifications" over how it would implement its side of the plan, the former UN secretary general said.
"What they mean and want is an assurance that the other forces, the opposition forces, would also stop the fighting so that we could see cessation of all the violence," he said.
Annan said his team has "had positive answers from them" and that "governments with influence" had also been approached to ensure that all sides in the conflict respect the ceasefire.
Turkey, a one-time ally of the Damascus regime, has called for Assad to step down to resolve the bloody uprising that has killed more than 9,000 people since it started a year ago, according to UN estimates.
Fifty-two people, including 28 civilians, were killed on Tuesday alone, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. They included 19 security force members and five rebels, bringing the toll since the weekend to at least 337.
"I again appeal to the Syrian government and the Syrian parties to cease violence in accordance (with) the plan," Annan said in Turkey Tuesday. "I believe there should be no preconditions for stopping violence."
Annan insisted his peace plan was not dead, however.
"We still have time between now and the 12th to stop the violence and I appeal to all concerned, the government in the first place, and the opposition forces," he said.
"The plan has not been implemented according to the schedule that we laid out... but it does not mean that it cannot be implemented."
At the same time, the Free Syrian Army, a ragtag rebel force of mainly army defectors, warned it would resume attacks if the regime offensive does not stop.
"If (the regime) does not stop shelling and not withdraw tanks, we will intensify our military operations and launch attacks," FSA spokesman Colonel Kassem Saadeddine told AFP.
Susan Rice, US ambassador to the United Nations, warned that the Security Council faces a looming "moment of truth" on Syria.
The "logical next step" would be to increase pressure through "collective action," she said.
