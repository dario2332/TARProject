  <text>The European Union will adopt new sanctions against Syria on Monday in light of continued bloodshed despite a week-old ceasefire, France's Foreign Ministry said on Friday.    
"In the spirit of the Paris conference, sanctions will also be adopted," spokesman Bernard Valero told a weekly press briefing.     
A "Friends of Syria" coalition meeting in Paris on Thursday called a U.N. backed peace plan the last hope to avoid all-out civil war in Syria and resolve the now 13-month-long crisis.     
The new measures would restrict exports of two types of merchandise: luxury products and certain raw materials that could be "recycled to be used for repression."
Syria ceasefire "very fragile", more monitors on way-Annan spokesman 
The full advance team of 30 ceasefire monitors should be deployed in Syria in the coming week and preparations are under way for up to 300, whose deployment is expected to be approved by the U.N. Security Council in the next few days, mediator Kofi Annan's spokesman said on Friday.
The week-old ceasefire is "very fragile" and the situation on the ground is "not good", with incidents and casualties reported every day, spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said.
"We have seven observers on the ground today, two more are arriving on Monday, to bring those on ground to nine," Fawzi told a news briefing in Geneva. 
Syrian cease-fire generally holds - MFA
According to a Russian Foreign Ministry official, Alexander Lukashevich, the Syrian cease-fire is generally holding, despite occasional violations and/or provocations.
The official feels this is quite an achievement, since the country could have otherwise slidden into civil war.
The Russian diplomat also pointed out that Moscow was prepared for talks with any opposition leaders favouring a political settlement in Syria. But he emphasized that no less important are the efforts that the Syrian government and opposition groups will make to implement international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan. A delegation of Syria's opposition Popular Front for Change and Liberation is due for talks in the Russian capital next week. 
Russia urges UNSC to speedily adopt another resolution on monitors 
Russia urges the UN Security Council to speedily adopt another resolution on a full-scale monitor mission in Syria, said the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, in a statement.
Russia's topmost diplomat suggested that the world community should rally behind the Kofi Annan plan and bend every effort to adopt another resolution that would approve a full-scale monitor mission in Syria. Lavrov was speaking during a news conference following today's talks between the Russian and Italian Foreign and Defence Ministers in Moscow earlier today.
Earlier, the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, suggested that a mission of international monitors for Syria should be speedily set up. He urged the Security Council to approve a plan at an early date for boosting the mission strength. Ban Ki-moon admitted that the proposal for sending 300 observers to Syria is a risk, but agreed that this could hold out chances of a crisis settlement.
Damascus to ensure support for UN monitors in Syria 
The Syrian government has assured the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, that it will ensure a favourable environment for the UN observers to monitor the ceasefire in the Arab country.
Ban Ki-moon said this in a statement for the reporters following the latest UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Syria. The standoff between the Syrian government and the armed opposition has been going on for more than a year.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he had advised the UN Security Council to authorize the deployment of 300 military monitors to Syria.
The Russian and Italian Foreign and Defence Ministers are due to discuss the situation in Syria and in the North of Africa during their meeting in Moscow later today. President Dmitry Medvedev is expected to attend the meeting.
