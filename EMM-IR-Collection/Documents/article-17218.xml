  <text>Two British servicemen who were shot dead by members of the Afghan police force in Helmand on Saturday have been named by the Ministry of Defence.
Lance Corporal Lee Thomas Davies, 27, from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was killed alongside Corporal Brent John McCarthy, 25, of the Royal Air Force at a patrol base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province.
The servicemen were providing security for a meeting with local officials when two people wearing Afghan police uniforms opened fire.
L/Cpl Davies, from Carmarthen, Wales, passed out from Catterick in April 2010, before joining the Welsh Guards. He was described as an "exemplary member of the Welsh Guards" and was "an extremely popular and respected member of his company and platoon".
Cpl McCarthy was born into a service family in Hanover, Germany, before returning to the Midlands, where he grew up in Telford, Shropshire. He was embedded with the Welsh Guards as part of the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group at the time of his death.
Lieutenant Colonel Dino Bossi, Commanding Officer Police Mentoring and Advisory Group, 1st Battalion The Welsh Guards, said: "His intelligence, ready wit and his desire to muck in and take part in all aspects of communal life meant that he fitted seamlessly into an extremely tight team."
Cpl McCarthy and L/Cpl Davies were attending a meeting as part of a Police Advisory Team at the local Afghan Uniformed Police headquarters near Patrol Base Attal at the time of the attack. The pair came under small arms fire, during which both were fatally injured. It is thought that two assailants were responsible for the attack.
Secretary of State for Defence Philip Hammond paid tribute to the pair
He said: "I send out my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of Corporal Brent McCarthy and Lance Corporal Lee Davies, whose lives were cut tragically short by a cowardly act of aggression.
"Both servicemen were performing an invaluable role, training and mentoring Afghan police, helping to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be a place from which international terrorists can launch attacks on our society. Their sacrifice will not be in vain and we will never forget them."
