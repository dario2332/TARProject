  <text>The first six United Nations monitors have arrived in Damascus as part of a peace plan designed to end 13 months of bloodshed in Syria, international media reported.
The six observers would begin their fieldwork later on Monday, Kieran Dwyer, a spokesman for the UN peacekeeping department, was quoted in media reports as saying.
The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Saturday to send a group of 30 observers to Syria to monitor a fragile ceasefire between government and opposition forces which came into effect on Thursday. The ceasefire is part of a peace plan for Syria proposed by UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
