  <text>AFP - Mali's new interim leader threatened to wage total war on Tuareg rebels and Islamists controlling the north of the country as he was in sworn in Thursday, ending a brief stab at military rule.
Dioncounda Traore, the former parliament speaker, took the oath of office in the capital of the west African nation at a ceremony attended by, among others, junta leader Captain Amadou Sanogo who grabbed power in a March 22 coup.
Traore, 70, took charge of a nation facing its worst-ever crisis, threatening to unleash "total war" on the Tuareg rebels, Islamists and outlaws who overran Mali's vast desert north during the power vacuum created by the coup.
"I am aware of being the president of a country at war," said the mathematician turned politician, who is expected to name a prime minister and organise elections within 40 days.
The rebels must "stop the... pillaging, the rapes, they must leave the cities that they have occupied," he said.
If they don't, he added, "We will not hesitate to wage a total and relentless war."
The junta had launched the coup that toppled former president Amadou Toumani Toure on the grounds that the government was not effective in resisting a Tuareg rebellion which was rekindled in January.
But the rebels took advantage of the disarray in Bamako by capturing an area roughly the size of France, including the ancient town of Timbuktu, sparking warnings of humanitarian disaster in an area already gripped by acute food shortages and drought.
The West Africa regional bloc ECOWAS immediately condemned the coup, hit the junta with heavy sanctions and demanded it quit power, paving the way for Thursday's restoration of civilian rule.
But the junta is expected to retain some influence, with observers saying coup loyalists could be named to key ministerial posts, notably those linked to security as the army tries to reverse the massive rebel gains.
The coup leaders, Malian politicians and ECOWAS mediators are scheduled to meet in Burkina Faso this weekend to clarify the still murky management of the transitional period.
Regional foreign and defence ministers were meeting in Ivory Coast on Thursday to mull the prospects of a military intervention in northern Mali, as fears rise that the rebel-held region could become a haven for radical Islamists.
The 15-nation Economic Community of West African States has raised the prospect of sending a force of up to 3,000 men to try to reclaim the region, but the mission's logistical details and mandate are far from resolved.
"We prefer peace, but if war is the only solution, we will make it with our army," said Traore, who speaks French, Russian, English and Spanish as well as the Malian dialects Bambara and Soninke.
The Tuareg -- many of them heavily armed and battle-hardened from last year's Libya war where they fought as mercenaries for fallen dictator Moamer Kadhafi -- took advantage of Mali's political chaos to step up their long-simmering separatist campaign.
Joined by Islamist extremists linked to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), they made unprecedented gains in the weeks since the coup, but that loose rebel faction has reportedly splintered.
The main Tuareg rebel group, Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA), has declared an independent state, but their call has been rejected by the international community and by the MNLA's former Islamist allies.
Ansar Dine, the Islamist group that controls several key towns, has imposed sharia law in some areas under its influence and distanced itself from the Tuareg nationalist cause.
Traore, speaking after he was sworn in, categorically ruled out the prospect of a Tuareg state.
"We will never negotiate the partition of Mali," he said, declaring that he will back the army "up to the final victory, when Mali has recovered all its territory and regained its secularism."
The UN Security Council has warned of the growing "terrorist threat" in northern Mali, while the world body's rights chief Navi Pillay on Thursday said rights violations could be worsening in the rebel-held north.
Reports from the north "suggest that civilians have been killed, robbed, raped and forced to flee," she said in a statement.
Aid groups have also warned of a humanitarian crisis, where more than 200,000 people have been displaced by the fighting this year.
A video obtained by AFP before, during and after the seizure of the northern hub of Gao shows a city riven by chaos since the March 31 rebel takeover.
The footage shows empty prison cells, fleeing residents and looted Red Cross warehouses.
