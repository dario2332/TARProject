  <text>Rebels in Syria are partly responsible for the massacre of more than 100 people in the town of Houla, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says.
Lavrov said some victims had been killed at close range in a district controlled by rebels, reports the BBC.
The UN condemned the killings, saying government artillery was involved. Russia is a close ally of Syria.
UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan is in Damascus for talks on implementing his shaky six-point peace plan.
At a joint news conference with UK counterpart, William Hague in Moscow, Lavrov said that Russia was "deeply alarmed" by the massacre in Houla.
"We are dealing with a situation in which both sides evidently had a hand in the deaths of innocent people," he said.
"There is no doubt that the government used artillery and tanks and this has been reported by UN observers who have visited the scene," he said.
"There is also no doubt that many bodies have been found with injuries from firearms received at point-blank range. So the blame must be determined objectively. Nobody is exonerating the government or the rebels but we must understand how it happened so that it can never be repeated."
Asked if President Bashar al-Assad could be part of the solution in Syria, he said that ending the violence was more important than who was in power.
He added: "We do not support the Syrian government. We support the plan of Kofi Annan."
The Syrian government insists the killings were carried out by "terrorists".
"The alternatives are the Annan plan or ever increasing chaos and a descent closer and closer to all-out civil war and collapse," he said.
On Monday, China also condemned the "cruel killings".
Fighting in Syria has continued despite the deployment of some 280 UN observers monitoring the ceasefire brokered by Annan.
Opposition activists said at least 30 people were killed on Sunday when the army shelled the central city of Hama. The reports cannot be independently verified.
