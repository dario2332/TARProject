  <text>Twenty people have been killed since Sunday in clashes between police and protesters demanding the country's military rulers quickly transfer power to a civilian government, Egypt's Health Ministry said Monday.
The ministry also said some 1,750 people have been wounded since Saturday, when protesters moved into the square, scene of the 18-day uprising early in the year that toppled leader Hosni Mubarak. In the first two days of clashes, at least 13 people were reported killed.
Freelance journalist Jihan Hafiz said demonstrators have been breaking up concrete to throw and making molotov cocktails. On the other side, she said, state security forces are using a type of tear gas more potent than that used during the protests of January and February in Tahrir Square.
Hafiz said the makeshift clinic on the scene is overwhelmed with injured people and running out of medical supplies.

"Security forces have been using very toxic tear gas. I was here during the January-February revolution and I remember taking in some of the tear gas. And this time when I took it in, I nearly choked on my own saliva," freelance journalist Jihan Hafiz told CBC News.
"I did film here last night where I have [been] spending the last couple of nights. I filmed four dead bodies. When I asked the doctors how they were killed they said asphyxiation from the tear gas. So the tear gas, they're saying, is much more toxic than before.
"They're also using buckshot bullets, which shoot out three, four, five different pellets in many directions."
The army raided the square early Sunday, using batons, rubber bullets and tear gas on protesters, who were driven out before returning by the hundreds within an hour.
Officials estimated about 3,000 protesters remained in the square Monday, facing off with hundreds of black-clad riot police firing gas canisters and rubber bullets. Some demonstrators wore masks to protect against tear gas.
Parliamentary elections are due to start next week, but demonstrators say they fear leaders of the governing Supreme Council of the Armed Forces are trying to retain their grip on power.
Moshen el-Fangary, a senior general from the ruling military council, appeared at a news conference Sunday to insist that elections will go ahead as planned Nov. 28.
Many activists remain disillusioned with the military's handling of the post-revolution transition. The electoral system is cumbersome and complex and voting is spread out over months. Many are unclear over who is running.
Some say the ruling generals are nothing more than an extension of the Mubarak regime, and are calling on military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi and his council of generals to step down in favour of an interim civilian administration.
The military has floated a timetable that places the transfer of power late in 2012 or early 2013, but the protesters want it to announce a precise date. A growing number, however, want the military to immediately step down in favour of an interim civilian council.
