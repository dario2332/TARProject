  <text>CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian doctors say three people have been killed in a police and army assault to evict protesters at Cairo's central Tahrir Square.
The assault came on the second of two days of clashes between Egyptian security and protesters calling on the ruling military to quickly announce a date for the transfer of power to a civilian administration.
Mahmoud Said, a doctor at the nearby Munira hospital, said the bodies of two men were brought to the hospital on Sunday evening, while Mohammed Qenawy, a doctor at one of two field hospitals in the square, said a male protester in his early 20s also was killed.
The military took over when longtime authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak was ousted by a popular uprising in February.
