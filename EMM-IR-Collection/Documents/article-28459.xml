  <text>Children were frequently among those killed and wounded during attacks on protests and the bombardment of towns and villages by state forces, it said.
The team of investigators, lead by Brazilian expert Paulo Pinheiro, has not been allowed into Syria, but based their report on more than 200 interviews of victims and witnesses conducted in the region and Geneva.
They were able to confirm 207 deaths during the two-month period. The United Nations is deploying up to 300 unarmed military observers in Syria to monitor an April 12 truce that has yet to take hold.
Security forces used lethal force against demonstrations in Aleppo, Damascus, Deraa, Hama, Homs, Idlib and in numerous villages across the country since March, the report said.
"Other unlawful killings took place during government military operations undertaken to weed out defectors, anti-government armed groups, their families and other opponents perceived to be supporting anti-government armed groups."
The UN panel said it had received multiple reports of the armed opposition executing members of the army and security forces, suspected informers and collaborators.
It has already drawn up a secret list of Syrian officials suspected of ordering crimes against humanity and handed it over to UN rights chief Navi Pillay.
She has said that the situation in Syria should be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for prosecution.
