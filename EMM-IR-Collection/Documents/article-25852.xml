The Sydney Morning Herald
In an unmistakable snub, US President Barack Obama has left Pakistan off a list of nations he thanked for help getting war supplies into Afghanistan.
The omission speaks to the prolonged slump in US relations with Pakistan that clouded a NATO summit where nations were eyeing the exits in Afghanistan.
Tensions that Obama readily acknowledged raise questions about whether Pakistan will help or hurt the goal of a stable Afghanistan. Continued mistrust between the United States and Pakistan also threaten cooperation to eliminate al-Qaeda sanctuaries and could undermine US confidence in the security of Pakistan's growing nuclear arsenal.
"We need to work through some of the tensions that have inevitably arisen after 10 years of our military presence in that region," Obama said later.
"I don't want to paper over real challenges there."
Pakistan is not a NATO member but was invited to the summit on Sunday and Monday because of its influence in next-door Afghanistan and its role until last year as the major supply route to landlocked NATO forces there.
Pakistan closed those routes after a US attack on the Pakistani side of the border killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in November.
The last-minute invitation from NATO to join the Chicago talks was a sign of hope that the rift had healed.
But it hasn't. And Obama's dealings with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari made that clear on Monday.
Zardari came to Obama's home town expecting a separate meeting with the US leader like the one accorded to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But without a final deal to reopen the supply lines, no such meeting was to occur.
Obama, along with Karzai, did speak briefly with Zardari on the sidelines of a large group meeting on Monday. Karzai dismissed the encounter in an interview with CNN as a "three-way photograph taking ... just a photo opportunity".
That was after Zardari had to sit by as Obama opened Monday's session with public thanks only to the nations north of Afghanistan who allowed expanded supply shipments to transit their territory to compensate for the closed Pakistani border gates.
"I want to welcome the presence of President Karzai, as well as officials from central Asia and Russia - nations that have an important perspective and that continue to provide critical transit for ISAF supplies," Obama said, referring to the International Security Assistance Force that is fighting the war.
The border crossing dispute is stuck over how much the US will pay Pakistan to allow trucks to transit its territory. Before the airstrike, the US paid about $US250 ($A253) per truck. Now, two US officials said, Pakistan wants $US5000 a truck and an apology for the deaths in the airstrike.
The Obama administration has said it was willing to pay as much as $US500 per vehicle and has expressed condolences and regret but no apology.
The prospects for reaching a deal were unclear, even as the stakes grow larger.
Obama told reporters at the close of the summit that he knew beforehand that there would be no deal on the supply routes now.
"President Zardari shared with me his belief that these issues can get worked through," Obama said. "We're actually making diligent progress on it....
"Pakistan has to be part of the solution in Afghanistan, and it is in our national interests to see a Pakistan that is democratic, that is prosperous and that is stable," he added.
The quarrel over supply routes is intertwined with several other disputes, including Pakistan's opposition to US drone strikes against terrorist targets inside its borders.
The NATO alliance needs Pakistan's cooperation to ensure Afghanistan's long-term stability and security, NATO's top officer told reporters.
That was a mild way of saying that Pakistan can play the spoiler at will and holds cards the fighting force does not. Pakistan shares history, culture and language with Afghanistan's restive southern swathe, and maintains support for Taliban-led insurgents who cross the border to kill US and NATO forces.
