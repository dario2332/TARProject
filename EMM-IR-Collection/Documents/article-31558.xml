Another 300 people were injured in the incident, Mr Mood told the  Security Council.
The deaths were from "shrapnel" and gunfire at "point-blank"  range, he said.
Syrian authorities have denied responsibility for the killings,  which have sparked international outrage and prompted the Security  Council meeting.
Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations also cast doubt  on the culpability of Syria's government for the massacre.
"We need to establish whether it was the Syrian authorities,"  Igor Pankin said at the United Nations. "There are  substantial grounds to believe that the majority of those who were  killed were either slashed, cut by knives, or executed at point  blank distance."
On Saturday, Mr Mood - the head of a UN observer mission deployed  under a peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan -  warned of "civil war" after the incident in Houla, which is located  in central Homs province.
UN observers had initially counted 92 dead in Houla, 32 of them  children.
Mr Mood on Saturday also called on the Syrian government to "cease  the use of heavy weapons, and on all parties to cease violence in  all its forms".
