  <text>Azerbaijan, Baku, Dec. 7 / Trend S.Isayev, A. Taghiyeva/
"Sanctions imposed on Syria will have no effect," said the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, Al Jazeera channel reported.
Syrian president added that the "sanctions are nothing new for the country".
President also touched upon the UN reports on human casualties, and pointed out that they are exaggerated, and false.
"Most of the killed people are Syrian army soldiers," he added.
Assad's family has ruled Syria with an iron fist for four decades. Syria has come under growing pressure from the United States, European Union, Arab League and non-Arab Turkey to stop the violence.
The Arab League has threatened to impose new sanctions unless Syria lets in monitors. In a letter late Sunday, Assad's regime said it will allow monitors but only if conditions are met.
The United States and France sent their ambassadors back to Syria, hoping that they will help shed a light on the violence and show solidarity with protesters after being pulled out due to security concerns.
Syria accuses "armed terrorist groups" of fueling the unrest, which comes amid a wave of street protests across the Arab world this year that have toppled authoritarian regimes in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.
