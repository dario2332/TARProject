International mediator Kofi Annan is heading to Damascus for talks with the Syrian government, a Syrian foreign ministry spokesman said.
The visit comes a day after the United Nations Security Council condemned the killing of 108 people in the town of Houla.
Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi confirmed in an email that Mr Annan would hold talks with Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, on Monday (local time) ahead of talks with president Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday.
Mr Annan brokered a ceasefire agreement last month which was aimed at stemming the violence in Syria after a year of protests against Mr Assad, and starting a process of political negotiations.
But hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the truce was supposed to come into effect on April 12.
On Sunday, the United Nations unanimously condemned the killing of at least 108 people, including many children, in Houla, a sign of mounting outrage at the massacre the government and rebels blamed on each other.
