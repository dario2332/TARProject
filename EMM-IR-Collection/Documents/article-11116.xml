  four day-old truce appeared to be crumbling hours after the arrival of the 
  first team of United Nations monitors, with Syrian government forces firing 
  dozens of tank shells and mortar rounds at neighbourhoods in the opposition 
The amateur video uploaded to a social media website purports to show heavy 
  shelling in the battered districts of Juret al-Shayah and al-Karabees 
  targeting apartments and residential buildings.
A small advance team of unarmed monitors who arrived in the capital Damascus 
  on the evening of April 15 to oversee the fragile truce, were undermined by 
  shelling of the opposition fighters by forces loyal to President Bashar 
Meanwhile, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has urged "maximum 
  restraint" from the Syrian regime and co-operation from the opposition 
  amid the unravelling ceasefire.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr Ban said, "It is very important that the 
  cessation of violence must continue."
