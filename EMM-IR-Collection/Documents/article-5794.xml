  <text>GENEVA (AP) — A team led by a Norwegian major general arrived in Damascus on Thursday to negotiate the possible deployment of a U.N. team that would monitor a cease-fire agreement between government troops and rebel forces, a spokesman for the U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said.
Ahmad Fawzi said the U.N. is already asking member nations to contribute about 200 to 250 soldiers who would monitor a U.N.-supervised cease-fire, which should come into effect on April 12.
Annan has asked the Norwegian major-general, Robert Mood, to "begin discussing with the Syrian authorities the modalities of the eventual deployment of this U.N. supervision and monitoring mission," Fawzi said.
Such a contingent would first have to be authorized by the 15-nation Security Council on which permanent members Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and France have veto powers.
Fawzi also warned Syria and opposition rebels that they have until April 12 to end all hostilities and comply with a cease-fire agreement crafted by Annan, as activists reported a fierce attack by government troops on a Damascus suburb.
Fawzi, a spokesman for Annan, said the Syrian government should remove its troops and heavy weapons from populated areas and "begin pullback of military concentrations in and around population centers" by April 10, and then both sides will have 48 hours to stop fighting.
"The clock starts ticking on the 10th for both sides to cease all forms of violence," Fawzi said.
Fawzi's comments were an attempt to clarify the sequence of events envisaged by Annan's peace plan aimed at bringing an end to an uprising that has left thousands of people dead.
France's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe says he's not optimistic about a peace plan for Syria and is ready to push for stronger U.N. action if the April 12 deadline for a cease-fire is not met.
Juppe said Thursday he thinks Assad "is deceiving us" when he promises to abide by the peace plan.
Syria, meanwhile, has told U.N. officials that it is withdrawing troops from the southern province of Daraa, the northwestern province of Idlib and mountain resort town of Zabadani, north of Damascus, Fawzi said.
But activists in Syria said Syrian troops are attacking the Damascus suburb of Douma, in what they described as one of the most violent campaigns there since the year-old uprising began.
The attack on the suburb of Douma and other offensives around the country bolster the opposition's claim that President Bashar Assad's is only intensifying violence in the days before a deadline to implement a cease-fire. Activists say Assad wants to make gains on the ground before the truce is supposed to take effect.
Fawzi warned that they do not "expect anything to happen magically."
"We expect things to happen methodically, in a disciplined manner, and yes, they have told us that they have begun withdrawing," Fawzi said, referring to Syria's authorities. "And we are receiving positive signals from the opposition that once the government abides by the 10th of April deadline, they too will lay down their arms."
The U.N. has previously said that Syria has pledged to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from populated areas by April 10, in what could be a first step toward ending the bloody yearlong conflict.
Syria's key ally Russia, meanwhile, said it could support a Security Council motion backing Annan's peace plan if it doesn't contain ultimatums to Assad's government.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov didn't specify whether he was referring to a Security Council resolution or a less binding statement, but warned that the document shouldn't contain "any ultimatums or threats."
Russia has grown increasingly impatient with Assad, criticizing him for being slow at reforms and urging him to take the first step in implementing Annan's plan.
Lavrov's warning against the use of ultimatums or threats in a U.N. motion backing Annan's plan indicated that Moscow will continue to protect Assad from foreign intervention.
Russia has vowed to block any U.N. resolution that could pave the way for a replay of what happened in Libya, where NATO action helped oust longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
