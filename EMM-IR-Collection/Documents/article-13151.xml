  <text>GENEVA (AP) — A spokesman for international Syria envoy Kofi Annan says the United Nations hopes to have 30 cease-fire monitors in the country next week.
Ahmad Fawzi says seven observers are already on the ground and another two will arrive on Monday.
Fawzi told reporters in Geneva on Friday that the preliminary agreement signed with the Syrian government this week guarantees the monitors freedom of movement and communication.
He says plans are already being made for the deployment of up to 300 observers in Syria. This larger contingent still needs to be approved by the U.N. Security Council.
Fawzi told The Associated Press that the issue of moving monitors around the country by air also needs to be resolved.

PARIS (AP) — France's foreign minister says the international community has to live up to its responsibilities in Syria and prepare for the possible failure of an increasingly fragile peace plan.
Alain Juppe said on France's BFM television Friday that if special envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan "doesn't function, we have to envisage other methods."
Juppe says France would support a U.S.-backed proposal for a U.N. arms embargo and other tough measures against Syria.
He says this peace plan is "the last chance before civil war. ... We don't have the right to wait."
Juppe hosted U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other diplomats in Paris on Thursday to try to work out options for Syria. The U.N. chief accused Syrian President Bashar Assad of failing to honor a peace plan that went into effect a week ago.
