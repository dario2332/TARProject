  <text>The UN-brokered ceasefire aimed at curtailing the conflict has already been marred with reports of violence. This comes amid doubts on the international stage whether the regime and the rebels can keep to the truce.
Syrian state media have reported a roadside bomb, which killed one army officer and wounded at least 24 other cadets and officers in Syria’s largest city Aleppo.
Syrian authorities accused “terrorists” of being behind the attack.
"At eight in the morning a terrorist group targeted a bus carrying a number of officers driving to work in Aleppo," Reuters cites Syrian state media as saying.
A member of President Bashar al-Assad's Baath party was also reportedly killed in a drive-by shooting in the city of Deraa following the ceasefire, the Syrian news agency SANA reported.
Local coordinating committees in turn have claimed Syrian forced opened fire on protesters outside the parliament building in Damascus, Al Arabiya reports.
The oppositional Syrian National Council had previously said three civilians were killed and dozens arrested since the ceasefire came into effect. The Syrian Revolution General Commission also said eight people had been killed by army gunfire across the country, the broadcaster reported.
None of the information has been verified.
Despite the isolated reports of violence, UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said the ceasefire “appears to be holding.” However, he told the UN Security Council That Syria is not fully complying with his peace plan, and the ceasefire remains fragile.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also told a news conference in Geneva "as of this moment, the situation looks calmer." Ban said the onus remains on the Syrian government to observe the ceasefire which he likewise described as "fragile."
The UN chief said he had begun work with the Security Council to send an observer team as soon as possible, saying the international community must remain unified to keep Syria from descending into chaos.
Russia’s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said the Security Council could adopt a resolution that would allow the deployment of an advance monitor group to Syria as early as Friday. He said Russia would participate in the monitoring mission, Interfax reports.
Syria’s ambassador to the UN said Damascus would agree to accept the mission as soon as the Security Council adopts a corresponding resolution. He also said Syria had become a victim of both “media terrorism” and “political terrorism.”
Meanwhile, Syria’s interior ministry called on those rebel fighters “'who do not have blood on their hands” to surrender.
The  call for gunmen to turn themselves in followed an official interior  ministry statement on state television asking all Syrians who had been  forced to flee their homes because of the conflict to return.
The head of the opposition group the Syrian National Council, Burhan Ghalioun appealed to Syrians to “demonstrate and express themselves,” insisting the right to protest is “the principle point” of Kofi Annan’s peace plan.
He urged the international community to provide Syrians with protection by sending observers to monitor the situation.
However, it will take time for the UN to respond to the request.
Fighting came to a standstill at 03:00 GMT on Thursday morning, following opposition reports of an escalation of violence. UN spokesman Ahmad Fawsi says the Assad regime reserves “the right to respond proportionately to any attacks.”
The Syrian Defense Ministry announced the ceasefire on state television on Wednesday, but neglected to mention the withdrawal of regime troops from urban areas stipulated in envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan.
Syria’s government stated that it had begun the gradual pullout of its forces from “certain provinces” on Tuesday.
Opposition activists however say they have seen no sign of tanks or security forces withdrawing from urban centers.
The international community has doubted the Assad regime’s commitment to maintaining the ceasefire.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the government’s promise to halt violence had “little or no credibility.”
"The burden remains squarely on the Syrian regime and not the opposition in the first instance to meet its obligations in full and visibly under the Annan plan," Rice told reporters on Thursday.
Russia, which has defended the Assad’s regime’s legitimacy on the international stage, urged the Syrian opposition to follow suit and keep to the ceasefire. Foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow was holding talks with the opposition to push for a truce, but emphasized “some of our international partners tell them different things and prevent the opposition from making any concessions – this is wrong.”
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is due to meet with Sergey Lavrov this Thursday at a G8 foreign ministers’ summit in Washington, where the Syrian conflict is expected to take center stage.
Kofi Annan will also brief the UN Security Council on his assessment of the situation.
Adel Samara, a Ramallah-based political analyst described the ceasefire as a waiting game in which both sides are poised to see who will fire first.
“We have to wait 24 hours to judge whether it is a real ceasefire,” he told RT.
If the ceasefire holds, he added, opposition representatives to conduct negotiations with Assad should come from “inside Syria.”
The UN estimates 9,000 people have been killed since the anti-Assad uprising began in March of last year.
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the second son of the late Libyan leader, told his lawyer he was prepared to defend himself in court, just like former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. But it’s still unclear which court will try Gaddafi Jr.
A 6.9 magnitude earthquake has jolted Mexico’s California peninsula. The tremor’s epicenter was 10.3 kilometers below the surface, and 133 kilometers from the town of Guerrero Negro.
there are reports of former libyan rebels evacuating libya for Syria, so you can see that all this so called opposition is nothing to do with people, it is against them. ibya mission seemingly accomplished, now they want to ruin Syria as well. So called "free" syrian army is not even worth to be captured. Traitors and foreign insurgents to murder off a country again ... if they succeed there is quite little to prevent a dark age to come ...
Russian first line of defense against NATO is Syria,otherwise she has to fight  not only the NATO,but Turkey,Azerbaijan,Goergia and Israelie army by the Caspian sea region,in order to protect her oil fields.Chinese first line of defense against western imperialism is Syria,as her energy from Persian Gulf and her export industry to the world,goes through Indian ocean.If she fails to nip this imperial agenda in the bud, in Syrian territories, she will certainly have no credibility,nor security in Indian ocean.Syria is also the first line of defense against Zio-imperialism,in Middle east.There is a new army in the region and growing day by day.Is called "Jerusalem militia army"(Al-Quds).She is a multinational army and recruits mainly from Middle east and North Africa and her objectives are ,total destruction of Zionism and her military regime in occupied Palestine,as well as complete extermination of Wahhabism and her military wing Al-Qaeda in ME and N Africa.
I feel a prophecy coming on....I prophecy this cease fire officially failed within 24 hours.
Indeed, feels almost like a cease fire wasn´t the GOAL at all...  Sadly, whoever starts to fire first, the media will turn it to Assad... that will be the invitation for all the hungry Killers from US and NATO to satisfy themselfs.
