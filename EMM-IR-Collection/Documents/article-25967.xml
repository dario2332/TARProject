  <text>The attack will alarm Washington as its involvement in the frontline state deepens.
The bombing wounded about 200 people, officials said, making it the bloodiest single incident in the city in recent years.
Yemen's defence minister and the armed forces chief-of-staff were both present at the rehearsal for today's National Day parade, but neither was hurt. A police source said he could not rule out that the bombing was an assassination attempt on them.
Weakened by an uprising that eventually toppled President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Yemeni government has lost control over large swathes of the country. Militants have overrun several towns in the southern province of Abyan.
The suicide attack, along with an ambush on Sunday on a US military training team, suggests that the militants' campaign might be entering a dangerous new stage.
The US sees Yemen as a vital front in its global war on Islamic militants.
The blast in Sabaeen Square, which is not far from the presidential palace, left scenes of carnage, with bloodied victims and body parts strewn across the 10-lane road where the rehearsal was held.
