Libyan spy and brother-in-law of Moamar Gaddafi, Abdullah al-Senussi has been arrested in a remote desert in south Libya after spending three months in hiding.News of the fugitive's capture came a day after the country's new rulers announced the arrest of Gaddafi's son and heir of the late dictator's former regime, Seif al-Islam, who had also been on the run for months.The 62-year-old spy was captured at his sister's home in the Al-Guira region on Sunday by transitional government NTC fighters.He is the last significant former regime figure to be captured.Southern Wadi Shati military council's head, Bashir Uweidat says Senussi "did not put up any resistance".Senussi served for decades as the intelligence chief and right-hand man of the late Gaddafi, who was arrested and killed last month."The terrorist, the assassin, Abdullah al-Senussi has been arrested," said an officer in the eastern city of Benghazi amid thunderous applause.DefeatDefence Minister Jallal al-Digheily describes the capture as a "victory".Senussi built up a reputation as the brutal enforcer of Gaddafi's will when he was the chief of internal security during a deadly purge of regime opponents in the early 1980s.Many Libyans also held Senussi responsible for the 1996 killing of around 1,200 inmates at Tripoli's Abu Salim prison.Senussi was a colonel in Gaddafi's armed forces and the powerful director of Libya's intelligence apparatus after previous posts as head of military intelligence and deputy chief of the external intelligence agency.He was one of several Libyan officials who were convicted, in absentia, in a French court in 1999 over the bombing of a French airliner. The plane came down in Niger the previous year, killing all 170 people on board.His arrest comes as Libyan officials announce the imminent trial of Saif will be held in Libya rather than at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.The court wants to try the 39-year-old for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Gaddafi's forces in crushing anti-regime protests in February.But the NTC insists Seif will face trial at home."The decision is that he will be tried by Libyan courts. It is a question of national sovereignty," NTC vice chairman Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said.
