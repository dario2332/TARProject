Syria's government has agreed to begin withdrawing its forces "immediately" and complete a pullback by April 10, according to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, one day after a gathering of more than 80 nations made a resounding pledge of aid to opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., also said Kofi Annan's diplomatic team is asking opposition forces to also withdraw from towns and cities 48 hours after the Syrian government withdrawal is complete.
Ms. Rice expressed skepticism, however, that Mr. Assad's government would follow through, a sentiment she said was based on past broken promises by the regime. "The proof is in the acting," she said.
Mr. Annan told the council Monday that time was running out for the Syrian regime to implement a six-point cease-fire plan it agreed to last week, several diplomats said. The plan calls for Syrian forces to cease hostilities and withdraw, after which armed opposition forces are expected to do the same. The government must also allow unhindered humanitarian aid.
Bashar Ja'affri, the Syrian ambassador to the U.N., said the April 10 deadline was reached through a "common accord" with the team of Mr. Annan, the joint U.N.-Arab League special envoy to Syria.
"We are committed to implementing the six-point plan," Mr. Ja'afffi said. A Western diplomat said Mr. Annan had sought an April 7 deadline but settled for the later date. Mr. Annan's plan doesn't call for Mr. Assad to step aside, as had an earlier Arab League plan.
Mr. Annan's briefing came against the background of growing resolve internationally to support the rebels with both lethal and non-lethal means.
On Sunday in Istanbul, a group of 83 nations billing itself as the Friends of the Syrian Peole pledged $100 million in salaries for members of the rebel Free Syrian Army, as well as $176 million in humanitarian aid.
Gulf nations, led by the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, were joined by Turkey on Sunday in openly calling for the rebels to be armed as the Syrian government continues its violent crackdown.
A senior Security Council diplomat said before the Istanbul meeting that Mr. Annan had spoken to Qatar about not providing arms, after Damascus said it wouldn't implement a cease-fire as long as foreign governments supported the opposition. That effort appears to have been overtaken, however, by new resolve shown in Istanbul.
The U.S. has pledged communications equipment for the rebels and remains reluctant to provide military assistance, fearing some might fall into the hands of extremist groups fighting along side the Syrian opposition.
In Turkey, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the progress made by the Syrian National Council to organize the opposition against Mr. Assad, the Associated Press reported. Speaking in the sidelines of a meeting with leaders of the Syrian opposition group, Mrs. Clinton said the achievement facilitates efforts by the international community to aid their efforts inside Syria.
"I really believe that, with the announcements coming from the meeting today, there will be greater pressure on the regime," Mrs. Clinton said.
The Vatican announced over the weekend that Pope Benedict XVI will donate $100,000 for charitable work of the local Church in Syria.
While efforts to aid rebels appeared to help break a diplomatic stalemate, observers inside Syria reported heavy fighting on the ground. Clashes on Monday killed at least nine civilians, 10 rebels and two soldiers, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based opposition group.
Heavy shelling by the Syrian military in Homs killed five civilians including one who was arrested at an army checkpoint Sunday, suspected of rebel activity.
In northern Idlib province, three civilians and five rebels were killed in military operations as the heavy shelling of several towns and villages continued into its third week.
A blast hit central Damascus, injuring at least four people when it exploded near a police station Monday afternoon, Syrian state television reported. Another bomb hidden in a small kiosk exploded in Aleppo, killing one civilian, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added.
Anti-regime activists have grown impatient with the lack of momentum to arm the opposition as the government continues its military operations in towns, villages and cities across Syria.
Russia lashed out at the Istanbul conference, and the calls for arms that emerged. In comments issued by its Foreign Ministry on Monday, it called the event "one-sided."
In a show of support to Mr. Assad's embattled government, Russia said Monday it was sending a navy destroyer to the Syrian port of Tartus, according to the Interfax news agency.
The destroyer will dock in Tartus in the coming days where it will conduct planned naval exercises, a previously scheduled trip. Russia leases the port from Syria, its only power base in the Mediterranean Sea. Russia has stood firm behind Mr. Assad, vetoing declarations in the U.N. Security Council that called for his ouster.
