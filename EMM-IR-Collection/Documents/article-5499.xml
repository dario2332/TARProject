The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said regime troops backed by tanks  stormed Douma at dawn amid heavy gunfire and shelling.
The Britain-based group said clashes between soldiers and rebel forces were  reported in various parts of the city, located some 13 kilometres (seven miles)  northeast of the capital.
Plumes of smoke could be seen rising near the city’s main mosque as troop  reinforcements were sent in, the Observatory said.
Violence across the country has left at least 170 people dead so far this  week despite a pledge by President Bashar al-Assad to implement a peace plan  brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
Two young men were killed in Kfar Sousa, a neighbourhood of Damascus early  Thursday when security forces opened fire on their car, the Observatory said.
Activists added that troops were also in pursuit of several other young men  in the neighbourhood.
Five soldiers were meanwhile killed in two separate attacks in the northern  province of Aleppo and in southern Daraa, cradle of the revolt that broke out  last year in March against Assad’s regime.
Clashes were reported in several towns of Aleppo province, including Andan  and Hritan where messages on loudspeakers urged regime troops to defect and  join the opposition, the Observatory said.
Washington on Wednesday criticised the “intensification” of violence  against opponents of the regime given Assad’s pledge to implement by April 10  Annan’s six-point peace plan.
“We’ve yet to be convinced that they have any intention of complying with  the April 10 deadline,” US State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters.
The unrest in Syria has left more than 9,000 people dead since mid-March  last year, according to UN figures.
The revolt against the regime began as a popular uprising but has  transformed into an insurgency many fear will lead to a full-blown civil war. - AFP
