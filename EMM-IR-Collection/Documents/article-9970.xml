  <text>The reports of violence come two days after a ceasefire began and ahead of a United Nations Security Council vote later on a Western-Arab draft resolution authorising a team to monitor the fragile ceasefire, reports Sky News.
The draft calls on the regime to allow access for up to 30 unarmed military observers.
It is unclear how many additional monitors will be sent in the coming weeks, but diplomatic sources suggest as many as 500.
The Russian foreign ministry said: "The resolution on the deployment into Syria of a UN monitoring mission advance group has been practically agreed for adoption at the UN Security Council."
The Council has threatened to consider "further steps" if Syria does not comply.
International pressure has grown for Syria to fulfil all its commitments to peace envoy Kofi Annan by withdrawing troops and heavy weapons, permitting humanitarian and media access, releasing prisoners and discussing a political transition.
In the re-written draft, wording has been changed and weakened slightly, in some cases from "demands" to "calls upon" or "requests".
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and other activists in Homs said shelling had wounded several people overnight.
And there have been reports from activists that four people were killed after forces opened fire at a funeral in Aleppo.
Syrians took to the streets across the country in small demonstrations on Friday, trusting the truce would put an end to the bullets that have frightened off peaceful protesters for months.
But Syrian forces loyal to Assad shot dead five protesters after Friday prayers, activists reported, adding that security forces came out in strength in many cities to prevent protesters mounting major rallies against Assad.
