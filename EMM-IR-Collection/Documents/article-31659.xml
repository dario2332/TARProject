  <text>Irish Sun (IANS) Sunday 27th May, 2012
The UN Security Council has called an emergency meeting to discuss the massacre in Syria's Houla town that left over 100 people dead, many of them children.
The city was shelled by troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Syrian authorities Sunday denied the involvement of government forces in the Houla massacre.
Jihad Makdissi, spokesperson for the Syrian ministry of foreign affairs, said the government has established a commission to investigate the events in Houla.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said the tragic events in Houla require careful investigation as there was information that the wounds of many victims were not the result of shelling.
