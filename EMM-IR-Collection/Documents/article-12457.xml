  <text>UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has recommended the UN Security Council to increase the number of international monitors in Syria to 300. Their mission should last three months, he said.
In a written statement addressed to the Security Council Ban Ki-moon also said that currently the conflicting parties are not fully observing the terms of the truce but there are opportunities to improve the situation.
Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged Ban Ki-moon to speed up submission of concrete proposals on the mission of monitors in Syria to the UN Security Council.
Syria hasn't fully complied with Annan's peace plan-UN chief Ban
Syria has not fully complied with its obligations to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns and has yet to send a "clear signal" about its commitment to peace, the U.N. chief told the Security Council in a letter obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said an expanded U.N. monitoring mission for Syria would he comprised of "an initial deployment" of up to 300 unarmed observers who would supervise a fragile week-old ceasefire between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters seeking to oust him. 
Ban Ki-moon proposes to send 300 observers to Syria
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in a letter to the UN Security Council, expressed concern over continuing clashes in Syria despite assurances by the conflicting parties that they were observing the ceasefire.
He said that Damascus had not fully complied with its commitments to withdraw all troops and heavy hardware from Syrian cities.
Ban Ki-moon thinks that a ceasefire monitoring mission in Syria should be expanded from 250 to 300 military observers.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the armed Syrian opposition of trying to stir up violence, disrupt the ceasefire and bury the Kofi Annan peace plan

Syrian Foreign Minister said in Beijing on Wednesday that his government was committed to the Annan peace plan and was doing everything possible to make it happen by ordering the troops to cease fire, releasing prisoners and distributing humanitarian supplies among civilians, while opposition militants persisted in their attempts to derail the settlement process.
Walid Muallem reiterated his government's desire to accommodate UN observers with an eye to stabilizing the situation and ensuring the security of the civilian population.
