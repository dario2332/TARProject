  <text>Anders Behring Breivik saluted as he entered the courtroom in Oslo on Monday morning.
OSLO &amp;mdash; A self-described anti-Islamic militant who admitted killing 77 people including scores of young people at a summer camp on a tranquil wooded island in Norway's worst peacetime atrocity went on trial here on Monday proclaiming that he had acted in self-defense, bore no criminal guilt and rejected the authority of the court.

Anders Behring Breivik, 33, has admitted on several occasions that he carried out the rampage on July 22, 2011, in which 69 people were shot and killed on Utoya Island, near Oslo, where the Youth Wing of the Labor Party was holding a summer camp. Hours earlier, a car bombing in central Oslo killed eight people.
Mr. Breivik betrayed no visible emotion on Monday as the prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh solemnly and painstakingly intoned the names of the dead. Asked by a judge whether he wished to plead guilty, he told the court, "I acknowledge the acts but I don't plead guilty as I claim I was doing it in self-defense." He had previously denied criminal responsibility on the grounds that he was protecting Norway against Islamic immigration.
As he entered the courtroom dressed in a dark suit on Monday, he delivered a clenched-fist salute with his right arm thrust rigidly out from his body, but shook hands with court officers. In a manifesto posted online shortly before the attacks last year, Mr. Breivik had described the gesture as the salute of the Knights Templar organization, which he claimed to have founded a decade ago. Prosecutors said in court on Monday that the group did not exist, apparently contradicting Mr. Breivik's initial assertions that he acted as part of a broader conspiracy rather than as a so-called "lone wolf."
Sporting a neatly trimmed beard around his chin and jaw, he seemed to alternate between nervous perusal of notes and smirks toward photographers.
"I do not recognize the Norwegian courts. You have received your mandate from political parties which support multiculturalism," Mr. Breivik said. "I do not acknowledge the authority of the court."
Asked to identify himself, he gave his name and denied a court official's statement that he was unemployed and lived in prison. "That is not correct," he said. "I am a writer and I work from prison."
His trial is set to last 10 weeks, with many Norwegian analysts fearing that he will use the occasion as an opportunity to broadcast his cause in a land that, like much of the Nordic region, prides itself on tolerance.
If he is deemed to have been sane when he carried out the killings, the five presiding judges can sentence him to up to 21 years in prison, with a provision to keep him behind bars for longer if he is still considered dangerous.  If he is deemed insane, Mr. Breivik can be kept in forced psychiatric care for as long as his illness persists.
Two court-ordered psychiatric reports have reached contradictory conclusions. The first report, last November, determined that Mr. Breivik was a psychotic paranoid schizophrenic before, during and after the attacks. The second, on April 10, said he was sane, albeit with a narcissistic personality disorder.
In a letter to the Norwegian news media on April 4, Mr. Breivik said the two psychiatrists responsible for the initial report were ideologically predisposed to pass an insanity judgment.
"Our political views are completely incompatible," he said, restating a belief "that multiculturalism is an anti-Norwegian, hate ideology designed to deconstruct Norwegian ethnicity, Norwegian culture and traditions, and Norwegian Christianity.
"Where I believe that multiculturalists facilitate the gradual Islamic colonization of our country, they consider that Islam is a great enrichment for Norway and Europe."
Mr. Breivik's lawyer Geir Lippestad has proposed calling witnesses from extreme ends of the political spectrum to demonstrate that Mr. Breivik's fears of Muslim colonization were not fantasies.
Among them is Mullah Krekar, an Iraqi-born Islamist cleric who moved to Norway in 1991 and was sentenced to five years in prison in March for making death threats against Norwegian officials and three Kurds.
Ron Atle, the leader of a far-right group, and Carl Hagen, the former leader of the mainstream anti-immigration Progress Party, will also be called, prompting claims from prominent Norwegian lawyers that Mr. Lippestad was planning to turn the trial into "a circus."
But the appetite among Norwegians for more coverage of the killings seems limited.
Saturation newspaper coverage since the attacks and three pretrial courtroom appearances have left many people in the country wanting to see less of Mr. Breivik, not more.
Dagbladet, the country's second-largest daily, has even introduced a Breivik-free version of its Web site for the duration of the trial.
