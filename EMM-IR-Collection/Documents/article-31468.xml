  <text>DAMASCUS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The recent massacre in Houla village of central Syria is a troubling sign that sectarian rift in the country has escalated despite that the conflicting factions said they are resolute not to slip into civil war.
The attack on Houla, a group of villages northwest of the central city of Homs, claimed the lives of more than 90 people, including at least 32 children under the age of 10.
The Houla villagers are Sunni Muslims. Activists claimed it came under heavy shelling by the forces allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad's Alawite sect, and later on by supporters of the Syrian regime. The activists said these supporters stormed into houses and stabbed women, men and children, apparently revenging for their role in the anti-government protests.
Syria, however, blamed the massacre on a "terrorist group" affiliated with al-Qaida, adding that the "terrorist" escalation came ahead of an imminent meeting of the UN Security Council and the UN special envoy Kofi Annan to Syria.
On Sunday, Syrian Foreign Ministry's spokesman Jihad Makdessi categorically denied any responsibility for the Syrian forces in the Houla "massacre," saying "we condemn in the strongest term this terrorist massacre."
He said the attacks came in parallel with the visit of UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan to Syria in a bid to promote the political process.
He stressed that "gunmen used at Houla pick-ups loaded with sophisticated weapons, including anti-tank missiles."
Makdessi said "instability is a climate where terrorists thrive. .. There are Qaida and Takfiris also but we would never allow them to take advantage of this climate no matter how long the confrontation might take."
Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the head of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria, strongly condemned the "brutal tragedy" that occurred Saturday in Houla and warned that the incident might evoke fears that Syria could dissolve into a new round of sectarian violence.
Speaking during a press conference, Mood said "the death of 32 children is something that is absolutely deplorable... It's an unacceptable attack on the future and on the aspirations of the Syrian people."
Mood stopped short of throwing a clear-cut accusation to any party, but he urged the Syrian government and the opposition to cease all use of violence in all its forms.
The Norwegian general warned that such violence will "create more instability, more unpredictability and may lead the country to civil war."
Mood's fears were echoed in a report published by the online Syria-politics website, which is close to the government.
The report said the Houla massacre has stirred up "sectarian congestion that is unprecedented in Syria's history."
The report, the website said, was based on a survey about the reactions of the Syrians on social networking and which included various segments of the Syrians from supporters and opponents of the Syrian regime, as well as political parties, and ordinary people who do not have any political affiliations.
The report said "regardless of the perpetrator of the massacre, it has achieved its goal in dramatically raising the level of sectarian tension in the country."
Furthermore, the report said the survey has pinpointed mounting fear and anxiety among some commentators who descend from the Alawite sect as many of them have raised the likelihood of leaving the country for fear of reprisals in the coming days.
The report concluded by stressing that the Sunni Muslims, who make up the vast majority of the Syrian population (70 percent), have historical immunity against sectarianism and they are one of the most moderate Muslims in the world.
However, it said, there are attempts by some fundamentalists and other regional powers to stir up sectarianism and plant the idea in the minds of the Sunni Syrians that they are victims of genocide, in order to "knock down one of the strongest fortresses of moderation in the Sunni world."
Moreover, some opposition parties have voiced rejection of any sectarianism in the country.
Tayyar Binaa Syria, or the Current of Building Syria, an opposition group, said in a statement on Sunday that the country is living fateful moments, warning that the continuation of the sectarian tension will not stop the bloodshed in the country but will increase the revenge and bloodshed.
"Civil war would soon come to the innocent Syrians," it warned, adding "we have warned repeatedly all internal and external parties of the conflict against walking towards violence and security chaos."
The statement also stressed that it is still rejecting any international intervention under the pretext of protection of civilians.
The Houla massacre has come after simmering tensions between Sunni and Alawite sects, especially in the restive areas of Syria like the central province of Homs amid unconfirmed reports of mutual abduction and killings on both sides.
Such sectarian rift has also reached the Christian minority in Syria that supports the regime particularly out of worries about the show of force by ultraconservative Islamists.
Sectarian rift recently spilled over into neighboring Lebanon where Sunni and Alawite Muslims were pitted against each other.
