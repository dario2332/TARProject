A colonel also was kidnapped in the central city of Hama. The government repeatedly has denied access to journalists, making it impossible to verify the reports independently.UN approves observer forceUnited Nations, AFP: The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously passed its first resolution on the Syria crisis, allowing an advance party of ceasefire monitors to go to the country on the brink of civil war. UN Resolution 2042 approved the first 30 unarmed military monitors, who UN officials said could leave for Damascus within hours.
