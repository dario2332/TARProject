  <text>Fighting linked to the Syria conflict has continued in the Lebanese city of Tripoli.
Monday saw more fierce clashes as tension spilled over between the Sunni Muslim community, whose members have led the Syrian uprising, and Alawite supporters of President al-Assad.
Medical sources say two men were killed and at least 20 wounded.
Tripoli, which lies 70 kilometres from Beirut, saw similar clashes earlier this year. The latest outbreak followed protests by Islamists after a man was arrested by the Lebanese authorities.
