  <text>The situation in Tripoli in northern Lebanon is now calm after several days of 
fierce fighting. The clashes pitted Alawi supporters of the Assad regime in 
Syria against Sunni Islamist partisans of the rebellion against his rule. At 
least 11 people were killed in three days of violence. A few days after the 
Tripoli incidents, clashes also took place between pro and anti-Assad Sunnis in 
the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
This followed the death, in unclear 
circumstances, of anti-regime cleric Sheikh Ahmed Abdul- Wahid at a Lebanese 
Army checkpoint in the north.
The spillover from Syria into Lebanon has 
now grown more complex with the kidnapping of 13 Lebanese Shia Muslims near 
Aleppo in Syria, allegedly by Syrian rebels. The Lebanese were returning from a 
pilgrimage in Iran. The Free Syrian Army has denied any connection to the 
Some Lebanese analysts believe that the first two of these 
incidents were deliberately orchestrated by the Syrian regime as part of its 
attempt to portray the rebellion against it as dominated by Sunni Islamists. 
Such claims should not be ruled out. The fighting in Tripoli and Beirut should 
serve as a warning sign as to what can be expected in Lebanon if the civil war 
currently under way in Syria continues and intensifies, and if the Assad regime 
begins to sense its own impending demise. The clashes in Tripoli took 
place along a well-established and well-known line of tension. This is the 
borderline between the neighborhoods of Bab al- Tabbaneh and Jabel Mohsen – two 
heavily politicized neighborhoods that tend to the geometrically opposite ends 
of the political spectrum. Largely Alawite Jabel Mohsen, a stronghold of the 
Syrian Social Nationalist Party, is one of the parties other than the Ba’ath 
legally permitted to exist in Syria. Once an ideological group, the SSNP 
is now a clanbased political-military organization well known for its members’ 
thuggishness and brutality. In Lebanon, it forms one of the tools available to 
the Assad regime. SSNP gunmen bore the main part of the fighting over the last 
Bab al-Tabbaneh, meanwhile, is home to a large gathering of Salafi 
Sunnis. It is, consequently, a center of support for both the revolt against 
Assad and the opposition to the current Hezbollah-led government. The spark that 
lit the fire for the clashes was the arrest by the Lebanese General Security 
Directorate of 25-year-old Sunni Islamist Shadi Mawlawi on vaguely defined 
“terrorism” charges. (He has since been released.) The subsequent fighting in 
Beirut, which was focused on the Mazraa area of the city, saw anti-Assad and 
anti- Hezbollah Sunnis attacking and destroying the premises of a pro-Assad 
The kidnappings in Aleppo led to stirrings on the 
other side of the Lebanese spectrum, as relatives of the pilgrims in Shia 
southern Beirut went out to the streets and blocked several roads with burning 
tires. The roads were reopened after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah appealed 
WHAT, IF anything, can be concluded from this sudden eruption 
of the Syrian crisis into Lebanon? First of all, it is important to realize the 
extent to which the politics of the two countries are linked by myriad 
Syria occupied Lebanon between 1990 and 2005.
the Syrian regime and the insurgency against it have allies in Lebanon, who seek 
to aid their respective causes.
It is undoubtedly the case that Tripoli forms a stronghold of support for the 
uprising against Assad. The border between Lebanon and Syria has served as one 
of the transit points for weapons and supplies for the insurgency. Assad’s 
Hezbollah allies, as part of the broader regional pro-Iran bloc, have been 
offering the beleaguered dictator their assistance in a variety of ways. 
Hezbollah and Lebanese Army forces are deployed on the border to prevent arms 
convoys from reaching the rebels. Hezbollah personnel have engaged in advising 
and training Syrian forces for urban warfare and have probably engaged directly 
in combat alongside the Syrians.
Yet until this month, the distinction 
between strife-torn Syria and quiet, if tense, Lebanon had been maintained. No 
longer. The following facts should be borne in mind:
The Syrian regime has a 
long record of utilization of proxy military organizations and of employing the 
“strategy of tension” whereby the regime first creates problems and then offers 
itself as the solution to them. This, indeed, has formed the core of Syrian 
regional policy under both Bashar and his father. The regime also has a 
particular liking for manipulating and making use of Sunni Islamists as a tool 
of its policy. Here, one should recall the open border policy maintained for 
Sunni militants wishing to take part in the insurgency against the US in 
The famous Ahmed Abu Adas, a Sunni Islamist who mysteriously 
appeared in 2005, (falsely) claiming responsibility for the killing of Rafiq 
al-Hariri, is a similar example of this policy.
present wants to portray its opponents as Sunni Islamist extremists, in order to 
cast itself as a bulwark against the spread of Sunni Islamism. The regime has 
long made clear that if its survival is threatened, it will not die quietly or 
alone. Rather, the impact will be felt in neighboring countries.
incidents in both Tripoli and Beirut were sparked by actions taken by the 
Lebanese authorities – the arrest of Shadi Mawlawi and the killing of Sheikh 
Abdul-Wahid. Mawlawi was arrested by the General Security Directorate, one of 
two main Lebanese internal security organs. It is widely regarded by Lebanese as 
closely linked to the Syrian regime. Given this track record and given 
the intensifying civil war situation in Syria, it seems probable that the sudden 
chain of incidents spreading tensions to Lebanon is not happening purely by 
chance. Rather, the Assad regime is doing what it knows. The Assads specialize 
in an often crude and transparent application of the methods taught them by the 
communist police states that were once their closest allies. Lebanon appears to 
be currently experiencing the latest manifestation of this.
