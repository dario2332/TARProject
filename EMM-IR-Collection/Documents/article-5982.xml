Beirut - UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said Thursday both  Syria government forces and opposition rebels had committed to a  ceasefire starting April 12 at 6 am local time.
'I urge the government and the opposition commanders to issue  clear instructions so that the message reaches across the country,  down to the fighter and soldier at the local level,' Annan told the  UN General Assembly in New York.
The ceasefire is part of a plan proposed by Annan to end the  conflict, which started more than a year ago with mass protests to  demand the President Bashar al-Assad step down.
Annan said Thursday Damascus had issued instructions to its armed  forces to start pulling back from populated areas, to halt new troops  movements as well as end the use of heavy weapons.
He said 'interlocutors' in the opposition had expressed commitment  and readiness to cease the violence within 48 hours of April 10, in  line with demands by the UN Security Council.
'All parties must immediately cease all violence,' Annan said in a  videoconference with the UN agency.
He added that the ceasefire was the top priority in his six-point  plan that Damascus had agreed to implement.
The 15-nation council Thursday issued a statement supporting  Annan's plan that also calls for access to humanitarian services and  talks between the Syrian government and the opposition.
The council added it was ready to 'authorize an effective and  impartial supervision mechanism upon implementation of a cessation of  armed violence in all its forms by all parties.'
In Damascus, a UN advance team discussed with Syrian officials the  deployment of peace observers, as activists reported new violence  around the country.
'The team is already in Syria. They are the guests of the Syrian  government. Their talks are being held at the Foreign Ministry,' UN  spokesman in Syria Khaled al-Masri told dpa.
A UN source has said Major General Robert Mood from Norway, who  has vast experience in peacekeeping missions, will be heading the  observer mission once a ceasefire is in place.
'The focus of the UN team's talks is on the logistics, once a  ceasefire is implemented, and where the monitors will be positioned,'  a Western diplomat based in Beirut told dpa.
'There will be some 250-300 observers and the UN has already  started to ask member states if they would like to send troops to  participate in the mission,' the diplomat said on condition of  anonymity.
Syrian state-run media reported that troops had withdrawn from  some areas in Daraa in the south, Idlib in the north, and Zabadani on  the outskirts of Damascus. The opposition dismissed the report.
'What kind of a withdrawal is the regime talking about?' Waldi al-  Buni, a Syrian opposition politician, said. 'Today there are military  operations across Syria and more reinforcements on the ground.'
At least eight Syrian soldiers were killed in fierce fighting with  army defectors in the district of Deir Balaba in the volatile  province of Homs, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human  Rights said.
Seven civilians were killed in government shelling of the  province, added the group added.
Activists near Damascus told dpa that troops had attacked the  city's suburban area of Douma, adding it was the worst assault on the  area since an anti-government uprising started in March 2011.
At least five civilians were killed in the attack, they said.
'The regime is now focusing on Douma because they believe a number  of the opposition Syrian Free Army are hiding inside the area and are  planning attacks inside the capital,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, the  head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The observatory said troops had clashed with army defectors in the  northern towns of Hraytan and Anadan near Syria's third largest city  of Aleppo. Three people were killed in the fighting, it added.
The state news agency SANA reported that authorities had foiled  an infiltration attempt into Homs by an 'armed terrorist group' in  neighbouring Lebanon. 'One terrorist was arrested while the others  fled,' it added.
News from Syria is hard to verify as the government bars most  foreign media from restive areas.
More than 9,000 people have been killed in Syria since the  conflict started, according to the UN.
