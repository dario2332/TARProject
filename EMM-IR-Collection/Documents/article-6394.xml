  <text>The Syrian government has begun withdrawing troops from some parts of the country to implement a six-point peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
"They told us they have begun withdrawing troops from certain areas," Ahmad Fawzi, the former UN chief's spokesman, said on Thursday, adding that "we are in the process of verification".
Annan said on Monday that the Syrian government had accepted the deadline, adding that he would push for an end of rebel operations within 48 hours after the government stops fighting and pulls its forces back.
The six-point plan also called for a daily two-hour halt in fighting for the delivery of humanitarian aid and treatment for the wounded, as well as talks between the government and the opposition.
"What we expect on April 10 is that the Syrian government will have completed its withdrawal from populated centers ... and then we begin a 48-hour period during which there will be a complete cessation of all forms of violence by all parties," said Fawzi.
Meanwhile, a UN planning team led by Norwegian Major General Robert Mood flew on Thursday to Damascus to try to broker an agreement that allows observers to be deployed across Syria to monitor a cease-fire demanded by an international peace plan.
In response to Annan's request, the United States drafted a UN Security Council statement endorsing the timeline for ending the year-long conflict in Syria that has killed more than 6,000 people as Syrian government reported.
Negotiations on the text began on Tuesday. France's UN envoy Gerard Araud said he hoped it would be adopted late on Wednesday or on Thursday.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing on Thursday that China supported Annan's mediation efforts and urged the Security Council and the international community to provide constructive assistance to Annan.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that Moscow could support the motion on Syria if it doesn't contain ultimatums or threats to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.
Lavrov didn't specify whether he was referring to a Council resolution or a statement, but Moscow has strongly supported Annan's plan and urged Assad to take the first step to end bloodshed.
Annan was scheduled to brief the UN General Assembly via video on Thursday on the latest development in Syria and the progress of his mission. He will also travel on April 11 to Teheran, where he is to seek support for his peace plan.
The US would offer an initial $1.25 million to the "Syria Accountability Clearinghouse", US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced at second "Friends of Syria" meeting in Istanbul of Turkey on Sunday.
Delegates at the conference also agreed to recognize the oppositional Syrian National Council as the sole representative of the Syrian people.
China hopes the words and acts help promote an early cease-fire and the launch of political talks, and safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East, said Hong.
The "Friends of Syria" group of Western and Arab nations is undermining Annan's efforts to end the bloodshed in Syria, Lavrov told Russian media on Wednesday.
"Everyone has supported Kofi Annan's plan but decisions at the 'Friends of Syria' group meeting aimed at arming the opposition and at news sanctions undermine peace efforts," he said.
