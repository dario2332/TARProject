  <text>At least three people were killed in violence across Syria on Thursday even as authorities in Damascus penned an agreement aimed at putting a stop to 13 months of bloodshed, a monitoring group said.
One civilian was killed during an assault by government forces in the northeastern oil city of Deir az-Zour and two others died from gunfire in the town of Yabroud, north of Damascus, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The casualties brought to 123 the number of civilians who have died since a UN-brokered ceasefire went into effect in Syria a week ago on April 12, said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based watchdog.
Three civilians were also wounded on Thursday in the assault on Deir az-Zour where fighting was raging between government troop and rebel fighters, the group said.
It also reported clashes in Daraa, south of Damascus, cradle of the 13-month uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, as well as in the flashpoint central province of Homs.
"A shell is falling every five minutes on the town of Qusayr as government troops carry out raids in the eastern part of the town," the Observatory said.
In Homs itself, heavy gunfire and loud explosions were heard in several neighborhoods.
The violence came as authorities in Damascus signed a preliminary accord outlining a protocol for a UN mission to monitor the fragile week-old ceasefire.
Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad signed the deal with a member of a UN advance team, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Although the number of casualties has gone down since the truce went into effect, the violence has continued unabated despite assurances by Syrian authorities they would respect the ceasefire.
Violence on Wednesday killed 30 people, 22 of them civilians, the Observatory said.
In a report to be discussed by the Security Council on Thursday, the UN chief said he wanted 300 unarmed observers sent on a three-month mission, adding it was "critical" that Assad's regime adhere to the agreed peace plan.
Ban's report, obtained by AFP, said that even though Syrian troops have not been withdrawn from cities and violence has escalated since the ceasefire, "an opportunity for progress may now exist, on which we need to build."
