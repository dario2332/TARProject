  <text>Security Council has authorised the deployment of the first batch of 30 unarmed monitors to Syria in a unanimous vote yesterday.
It also warned that it would "consider further steps" against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad unless Syria ends violence and complies with a ceasefire and six-point peace plan drawn up by the Arab League and UN envoy Kofi Annan.
Troops for the mission will be drawn from existing UN military-observer missions in the Golan Heights, Lebanon and Sudan and sources said they were ready to fly to Damascus within hours.
The resolution is the first to be passed by the Security  Council since the Syrian crisis -- which has pushed the country to the brink of civil war -- began over a year ago.
Significantly, it won the support of Russia and China, who had controversially vetoed previous resolutions aimed at bringing to an end  the violence that has claimed 9,000 lives in the past 13 months.
Russia's UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, said Moscow was satisfied with the latest western-Arab resolution authorising the deployment of the first batch of unarmed UN observers to Syria to monitor its fragile truce.
Speaking after the vote, however, Mr Churkin warned against "destructive attempts at external interference" in Syria.
The vote came as the fragile ceasefire that has been in force for three days was rocked by fighting in Homs, where regime forces shelled rebel-held neighbourhoods.
Rebel fighters were also reported to have fired rocket-propelled grenades at an area held by regime loyalists.
In Aleppo, Syria's largest city, regime forces opened fire on mourners attending a funeral, while rebel gunmen ambushed a car carrying soldiers in the southern province of Daraa.
The two sides have traded allegations of violations of the truce since it took effect formally last Thursday.
However, yesterday's reports of the use of heavier weapons suggested that the ceasefire was in jeopardy.
A video, shot in a destroyed part of what the cameraman said was the Homs neighbourhood of al-Qarabis, showed two tanks rushing through the streets to the sound of heavy gunfire and explosions.
