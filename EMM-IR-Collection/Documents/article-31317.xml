Australia's ambassador to the United Nations has been ordered to begin canvassing increased sanctions against the Syrian regime following its alleged massacre of 92 civilians.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said Australia's UN ambassador would also discuss with member states the possibility of referring the massacre to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The UN has said 92 bodies, 32 of them children aged under 10, were counted in the central Syrian town of Houla after reports of an artillery bombardment by President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
The Syrian government on Sunday night (AEST) denied responsibility for the deaths.
But Senator Carr appeared to blame President Assad and said perpetrators of the "hideous and brutal" violence must be brought to justice.
"The Assad regime must cease all military operations immediately, as required under special envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan," Senator Carr said in a statement.
"UN observers must also be allowed immediate access to Houla to start work on determining responsibility for this attack, as well as to all other conflict zones in Syria.
"This matter should also be immediately brought before the UN Security Council, for a unified international response."
Senator Carr said any UN response could include referring the matter to the ICC and the imposition of international sanctions, including arms embargoes and financial and travel restrictions.
"The international community can no longer stand by while the Syrian government fails to honour its commitment to (Annan's) six-point plan," he said.
Australia has already imposed unilateral sanctions against Syria including travel and financial restrictions against 106 individuals and 28 entities as well as an arms embargo.
