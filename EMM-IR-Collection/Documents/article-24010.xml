  <text>Future bloc MP Khaled al-Daher held the Lebanese army command, the cabinet and Prime Minister Najib Mikati responsible for the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed.
“The army command, the cabinet and [Mikati] are responsible… because they are not protecting Lebanon,” the National News Agency quoted Daher as saying.
“We were expecting gunfire from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party not from the Lebanese army,” he said, and calling for “a quick investigation” into the murder of Abdel Wahed and for “severely punishing” the perpetrators.
“They did not open fire in the air to warn [the sheikh’s convoy], and they did not shoot at legs. Sheikh Ahmad was [shot] in the neck.”
Meanwhile, Future bloc MP Mohammad Kabbara said the army command should “quickly answer” as to who made the decision to open fire on Sheikh Abdel Wahed.
The NNA reported earlier on Sunday that an “armed convoy” carrying Abdel Wahed to the northern Lebanese town of Halba to participate in a rally refused to stop at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Akkar.  According to the report, the Lebanese army opened fire when the convoy failed to stop, which led to the death of Abdel Wahed and a bodyguard identified as Mohammad Hussein Merheb, both from the town of Al-Beri.
