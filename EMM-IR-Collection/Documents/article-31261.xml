  <text>The Syrian government has denied responsibility for an attack that killed at least 85 people, including 34 children, saying that it was carried out by "terrorists".
Jihad Makdissi, the spokesman for the Syrian foreign ministry, also severely criticised foreign leaders for accusing the government of having committed atrocities "without any evidence".
He told a press conference that "hundreds of armed men" had attacked Houla, a cluster of villages in Homs province, on Friday and clashed with government forces.
"They used heavy weapons and anti-tank rockets," he said on Sunday. "That's why we lost some of our men from the security forces."
Makdissi said Syrian forces were trying to defend themselves but insisted that "no Syrian artillery or heavy weaponry" had been used in Houla. 
"Syria will continue defending its citizens," he said.
Earlier, UN chief Ban Ki-moon and UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan condemned the assault, calling it an "appalling and brutal" breach of international law.
Ban and Annan "condemn in the strongest possible terms the killing, confirmed by United Nations observers, of dozens of men, women and children" in Houla, UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said on Saturday.
"This appalling and brutal crime, involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centres and violence in all its forms," said the statement issued on behalf of the UN secretary-general and the Syria envoy.
Major General Robert Mood, the chief of the observer mission deployed to Syria, said monitors touring the area had counted 85 bodies, including 34 children under the age of 10 and seven women.
"Whoever started, whoever responded and whoever supported this deplorable act of violence should be held responsible."  Mood said about Friday's assault.
The head of the observer mission talks to Al Jazeera
&lt;!-- PAGELOADEDSUCCESSFULLY--&gt;He told Al Jazeera that a residential area had been hit with a range of weapons, including "rifles, machine guns, artillery shells, tank shells," but stressed that the circumstances that "led to the tragic deaths" were still unclear.
"Whatever I learned on the ground in Syria ... is that I should not jump to conclusions."
The statements came as the Free Syrian Army said it could no longer commit to the ceasefire brokered by Annan unless there was an immediate solution to regime violence.
"We announce that unless the UN Security Council takes urgent steps for the protection of civilians, Annan's plan is going to go to hell," a statement by the FSA said on Saturday.
The peace plan drawn up by Annan, which took effect on April 12, stipulated that UN observers be deployed in the country to monitor a ceasefire. But the violence and bloodshed have not stopped.
Activists from the region said government forces hammered Houla with mortars following a large anti-government protest on Friday.
After the bombardment, pro-government thugs, known as shabiha, raided the villages, killing men on the streets and stabbing women and children in their houses, activists said.
Houla has been the scene of frequent anti-government protests since the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began in March last year. The town has also become a hub for opposition fighters.
Hadi al-Abdallah, speaking from Homs, said Houla was under the control of the FSA, which meant government troops could not enter the town. Instead, they were launching shells from a distance in a bid to defeat the rebels.
International condemnation
Arab League foreign ministers are to hold an emergency meeting in the wake of the killings, the bloc's current president Kuwait said on Sunday.
"Kuwait will contact members of the Arab League to hold an emergency ministerial meeting to study the situation and take measures to put an end to the oppressive practices against the Syrian people," a foreign ministry statement cited by the official KUNA news agency said.
Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, condemned the killings "in the strongest possible terms" and said in a statement that "the United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end".
William Hague, the British foreign secretary, said "we are consulting urgently with our allies on a strong international response, including at the UN Security Council, the EU and UN human rights bodies".
London would seek an urgent session of the Security Council in coming days, in response to "credible and horrific reports that a large number of civilians have been massacred" by Syrian forces in Houla.
Syrians turned out in several locations around the country on Saturday to protest against the killings.
