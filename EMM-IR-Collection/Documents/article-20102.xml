  <text>MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary elections held in Syria on May 7 showed Syrian people's supports to the country's course of reform, said President Bashar al-Assad in an interview aired here on Wednesday.
"This is an important step, part of the reforms we have started about a year ago. The results show Syrian people still support the course of reforms, the majority supports the state's order," Assad told the Russia-24 TV channel. "This is a serious message to all both inside and outside the country. Syrian people was not scared by threats of terrorists who attempted to disrupt the elections."
Assad also said Damascus was going to ask UN-Arab League joint envoy Kofi Annan why the United Nations spoke solely about the violence from the Syrian government but kept silent on "terrorists. "
"They only speak about violence from the government. There is no word about terrorists. We keep waiting. Mr. Annan will come to Syria this month and I'll ask him, what's the matter," Assad said.
Assad added that the number of terror attacks in Syria has increased since the UN observers arrived in the country, insisting "the situation has not been improved."
