  <text>WASHINGTON: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denied ordering the killing of thousands of protesters and said "only a crazy person" would target his own people, in a rare US interview released Wednesday.
Speaking to ABC News, Assad brushed off widening international sanctions and questioned the UN death toll of more than 4,000 since the eruption of the unrest in March, saying most victims were government supporters.
Assad -- speaking to veteran journalist Barbara Walters in a rare interview to foreign media -- said he was not responsible for the bloodshed and blamed any excesses on individuals rather than his regime.
"There was no command to kill or be brutal," Assad said.
The United Nations estimates that more than 4,000 people have died since the uprising began in March, part of a wave of pro-democracy movements sweeping the Arab world that by now have toppled leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.
Assad dismissed the death toll, saying: "Who said that the United Nations is a credible institution?"
"Most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government, not the vice versa," Assad said, giving a figure of 1,100 dead soldiers and police.
Walters pressed Assad on the case of Hamza al-Khatib, a 13-year-old boy who rights group say was killed in April after being shot, burned and castrated.
"There is a difference between having a policy to crack down and between having some mistakes committed by some officials. There is a big difference."
Assad said that his government was moving ahead with reforms but stated flatly: "We never said we are democratic country."
"It takes a long time," Assad said. "It takes a lot of maturity to be full-fledged democracy."
Syria has faced growing international condemnation, including Western sanctions and similar action by the Arab League and neighboring Turkey.
