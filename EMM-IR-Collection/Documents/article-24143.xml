  <text>Tripoli’s Sunni Mufti, Sheikh Malek Chaar, said on Sunday that those who opened fire and killed Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed were detained.
“We were informed that those who opened fire and killed the sheikh were detained and that they were being [interrogated],” Chaar told reporters following a meeting held at his residence in Tripoli and attended by several political and religious figures.
The mufti also said that the participants called on residents of North Lebanon to “control themselves” and not to be dragged into “evil [schemes].” He also called on them to not block roads or not burn tires and to give the judiciary “the chance” to carry out its duties.
“We are sure that this crime will not go unpunished.”
Chaar added that “the crime which lead to the death of Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard will not shake the trust in the Lebanese army.”
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed. -NOW Lebanon
