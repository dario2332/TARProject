"He was evasive and we could not tally the clarifications that we had sought," a source said.
There was heavy police presence all throughout the day in Hyderabad, as there was an indication that his arrest was imminent. The CBI could have arrested him after the first day of his questioning, but they decided to give him an opportunity to clarify his position.
Moreover, Section 41 A of the Cr PC mandates that a person be given a notice of appearance before an arrest could be made.
