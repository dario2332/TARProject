UN condemns Syria over massacre
Syrian foreign ministry denies Houla killings
The UN unanimously condemns the Syrian government for heavy weapons attacks in Houla, the site of a massacre of at least 108 people.
SYRIA has drawn growing international condemnation of the deaths in  army attacks of more than  100 people, including dozens of children.
United Nations envoy Kofi Annan  arrived in   Damascus last night   after three days of army shelling left  at least 34 people, including  eight children,  dead in Hama.
Mr Annan was due to have talks with President Bashar al-Assad and other  senior officials, and will also meet representatives of the opposition  and civil society and review the work of the UN supervision mission in  Syria.

The Hama attack followed the massacre of more than 100 people, including  32 children, in the town of Houla. The attacks were condemned by the UN  Security Council.
Mr Annan said on his arrival that those responsible for ''brutal crimes'' in Houla must be held accountable.
The Syrian government said gunmen funded by foreign powers were responsible for the deaths in Houla.
The head of the opposition Syrian National Council, Burhan Ghalioun,  called on Syrians to intensify their revolt and unite against  Dr Assad,  saying they had nothing to lose.  He  accused world powers of failing  to shoulder their responsibilities to Syria.
The killings add to evidence that a ceasefire pact brokered by Mr Annan  last month has not deterred Dr Assad's efforts to crush an uprising that  began with peaceful protests and has evolved into an armed insurgency.   Dr Assad's forces have killed more than 10,000 people since March last  year, according to the UN.
The Security Council on Sunday  condemned ''in the strongest possible  terms'' the killings in Houla, in Homs province, without holding Dr  Assad's troops responsible, because of Russian objections. Alexander  Pankin, Russia's deputy envoy at the UN, said circumstances surrounding  the deaths were murky and it was  ''difficult to imagine'' the Syrian  government would massacre women and children.
Western and Arab powers accused Dr Assad's army of carrying out atrocities,  an allegation denied by his government.
Shortly before leaving for Moscow for meetings with Russian counterpart  Sergei Lavrov yesterday, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said  Russia faced a stark choice between using its leverage with the Assad  regime or risking its last bastion of influence in the Middle East  descending into chaos.
''The Russians have a great deal of leverage over the Syrian regime.   We've had many differences of view over Russia at the Security Council,  but Russia does support the Annan plan and so I hope Russia will  redouble its efforts to get the Assad regime to implement that plan,''  Mr Hague said.
''It's not in the interests of Russia, just as it's not in the interests  of anybody in the world, for Syria to descend into an even bloodier  situation and into full-scale civil war, and that is now the danger.''
Australian Foreign Minister Senator Bob Carr called in the Syrian envoy  to Australia  yesterday to express  the federal government's anger over  the massacre in Houla.
An editorial in China's state-run English-language Global Times yesterday  said  the West must not use the massacre as an excuse to push for Dr Assad's ousting.
Russia and China ''must firmly oppose the hysterical escalation of interventionism'', the editorial said.
Chief of the UN's observers in Syria General Robert Mood told an  emergency Security Council meeting  at least 116 people were killed in  Houla,  according to two diplomats at the meeting. Herve Ladsous, under  secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, put the figure at 108.
