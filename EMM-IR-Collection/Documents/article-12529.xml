  <text>TIKRIT, Iraq, April 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed and five others wounded in a series of bomb attacks in Salahudin province in north of Baghdad on Thursday, a provincial police source said.
One of the attacks took place in the morning when a car bomb went off in the city of Samarra, some 120 km north of Baghdad, killing two civilians and a member of a government-backed Awakening Council group, or Sahwa in Arabic, the source told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.
Four people, including two women, were also wounded by the blast, the source said.
In the early hours of the day, two policemen and an officer were killed when their police vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in western Samarra, the source added.
Also in the city, two civilians were killed and one Sahwa member was wounded in a car bomb explosion near a checkpoint manned by Sahwa fighters, he said.
The Awakening Council group, also known as Sons of Iraq movement, consists of mostly former anti-U.S. Sunni insurgent militant groups, who turned their rifles to fight al-Qaida network after Sahwa's leaders became dismayed by al-Qaida's brutality and religious zealotry in the country.
In addition, a soldier was killed when a roadside bomb went off near an Iraqi army checkpoint on a main road near the town of Ishaqi, 110 km north of Baghdad, the source said.
In a separate incident, a suspected gunman was killed in the morning when a bomb he was carrying in his car went off in the city of Dujail, some 60 km north of Baghdad, he said.
Salahudin province, located in northern central Iraq, is a Sunni-dominated province. Its capital city of Tikrit, some 170 km north of Baghdad, is the hometown of former President Saddam Hussein.
Earlier, the police reported a series of bomb attacks in and near Baghdad that killed at least nine and wounded 24 others.
Violence is still common in Iraqi cities despite the sharp decrease since its peak in 2006 and 2007, when the country was engulfed by sectarian killings.
