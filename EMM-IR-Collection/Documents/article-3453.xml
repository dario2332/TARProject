Police say a weapon was found next to the second victim of a shooting at Virginia Tech university, but have refused to confirm reports it was the gunman.
Two people, including a campus police officer, were shot dead on Thursday, as violence returned to the university which was the scene of the deadliest school shooting in US history in 2007.
Police refused to confirm reports the second fatality might have been the shooter himself, even as the 31,000-student university lifted an afternoon-long lockdown and declared there was no longer an "active threat".
But when asked if the gunman was at large, Virginia State Police spokesman Bob Carpentieri cryptically told reporters: "Investigators feel confident that they have located the person."
The slain police officer, a four-year veteran of Virginia Tech's own security force, was shot and killed during a noon-hour "routine traffic stop" in a parking lot near a sports facility.
"Witnesses reported to police the shooter fled on foot heading toward the Cage, a parking lot near Duck Pond Drive," the university said in a statement on its website.
"At that parking lot, a second person was found. That person is also deceased."
No names were disclosed but Carpentieri said a weapon was found close to the second victim, who he described as a white male.
He also said the gunman was not the motorist who the slain police officer had pulled over.
Virginia Tech was the scene of the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in US history when an English major, Seung-Hui Cho, 23, killed 32 people before taking his own life in April 2007. Twenty-five others were wounded.
"It brings back difficult memories from the past," Virginia Tech president Charles Steger told reporters.
Thursday was a study day on the eve of final exams for the fall term, which now are being rescheduled.
Ironically, Virginia Tech officials - including the campus police chief - were in Washington on Thursday to appeal a $US55,000 ($A54,281) fine for failing to promptly issue an email alert after Cho shot his first two victims in a dormitory.
One unidentified student, fighting back tears, told local WDBJ television she witnessed the fatally wounded police officer fall out of his unmarked vehicle when colleagues opened its door.
"He just fell out towards the ground, and then they immediately started reviving him, and then two cops took off with some sort of automatic weapons, I guess, running in the opposite direction after the gunman," she said.
"I guess the officer didn't make it because they just covered him with a sheet."
The gunman was described as a white male in a maroon hooded jumper and grey tracksuit pants. Maroon is the official colour of Virginia Tech.
