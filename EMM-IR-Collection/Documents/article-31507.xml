  <text>The UN Security Council is to hold a meeting to discuss the recent massacre in the Syrian town of Houla, in which at least 90 people, including many children, were killed.
The UN has blamed Saturday's attack on Syrian government forces, but Damascus says the deaths were due to a rebel attack.
The meeting, to be held on Sunday at 18:30 GMT, comes after Britain and France proposed a statement condemning the massacre.
A senior Russian diplomat has also said the killing "deserves condemnation" but that it was too early to say who was to blame.
"The tragic events in Syria and the deaths of tens of people deserve condemnation. However it is necessary to seriously examine the causes of what happened," Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said on Twitter.
"Let's wait for the objective evaluations of the UN mission," he said.
Blaming "terrorists" for the killings on Friday and Saturday, government spokesman Jihad Makdissi said Damascus had opened an investigation, with results expected within three days.
"Not one Syrian tank went in" to Houla, Makdissi said.
Gatilov's remarks suggested Russia, which has backed Assad with weapons supplies and vetoes in the Security Council, was seeking to cast doubt on accounts the government was to blame.
"There is information that the nature of the wounds received by many of those who died are not the result of shelling," he said.
Opposition activists said Assad's forces shelled Houla after a protest and then clashed with fighters from the Sunni Muslim-led insurgency.
Activists say Assad's 'shabbiha' militia, loyal to an establishment dominated by members of the minority Alawite sect, then hacked dozens of the victims to death, or shot them.
Russia blames armed opponents of Assad's government for most of the violence that has persisted since a UN-backed ceasefire took effect on April 12, and says they are receiving foreign backing and arms.
Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, joined Arab League-UN envoy Kofi Annan in releasing a statement condemning of the massacre.
"This appalling and brutal crime, involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, is a flagrant violation of international law," the two officials wrote.
The White House said on Sunday it was horrified by the reports of brutal attacks in Houla, calling the actsfurther evidence of an inhuman and illegitimate Syrian government.
"These acts serve as a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality," a White House spokesman said.
