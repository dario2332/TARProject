Mr. Assad agreed this week to implement the cease-fire from April 10. The truce is the keystone of a six-point plan put forward by Mr. Annan, the joint United Nations-Arab League envoy. It requires regime forces to withdraw from towns and cities, followed by a withdrawal by rebel fighters. All sides are then supposed to hold talks on a political solution.
A Syrian government official said Tuesday that troops had begun withdrawing from some calm cities and were moving to the outskirts of tense areas. He gave no further details.
Activists reached by telephone Wednesday in north, south and central Syria said they had seen no sign the military was pulling out.
Some reported the opposite. "They are still sending in reinforcements," said Yazeed al-Baradan in the southern town of Tafas. He said government tanks and armored cars pushed in early in the day, beefed up checkpoints around the city and torched more than a dozen homes of known regime opponents.
Track events day by day in the region.
Another activist in the northern province of Idlib gave a similar report. "We don't see any proof of withdrawals here," said Fadi al-Yassin. "Anyone who gives a promise to the U.N. that he will withdraw his troops has to show good intentions, but we know Assad has no good intentions. These are just maneuvers by the regime."
The opposition suspects Mr. Assad agreed to the plan to buy more time to continue his crackdown on the revolt.
Syria's uprising began in March 2011 when protesters inspired by other Arab Spring revolts took to the streets to call for political reform. The regime has tried to violently quash spreading dissent, and many in the opposition have since taken up arms.
But the local rebels fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army are outgunned by Mr. Assad's large, professional forces, and the failure of diplomacy to stop the violence has left many rebels calling for more arms.
"We have only one demand and that is the arming of the Free Army," said Mr. Baradan, the Tafas activist. "Then, God willing, we will topple the regime ourselves."
A group of some 70 nations pledged this week to supply the opposition with aid and communications equipment, while Saudi Arabia and some of its Gulf Arab neighbors have started a fund to support rebel fighters. Much about the fund remains unclear, and any weapons reaching the rebels from outside Syria have yet to make a noticeable difference on the ground.
Syrian ally Russia warned that if other countries armed the opposition, it would exacerbate the conflict.
"Even if they arm the Syrian opposition to the teeth, it won't be able to defeat the Syrian army," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. "The carnage will go on for many years."
Most opposition figures dismiss the Annan plan as too little, too late.
Activists around the country reported government shelling, raids and gunfire that killed dozens of civilians and a number of rebel fighters and government soldiers.
Activist videos posted online showed explosions and columns of black smoke rising from the rebellious central city of Homs, apparently from government shelling.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 28 civilians were killed in government attacks in Homs and nearby towns.
It said rebels clashed with government troops in the area, trying to stop the government's advances, leaving four opposition fighters and 14 soldiers dead.
The Observatory also reported government shelling and raids in Idlib and southern Daraa provinces as well as an explosion in Beit Saham near Damascus that killed seven people. The Syrian government reported seven dead and blamed the blast on "terrorists" preparing explosives.
The Observatory and another activist network, the Local Coordination Committees, put the day's death toll at more than 50.
Activists' claims couldn't be independently verified. The Syrian government rarely comments on specific incidents and has barred most media from working in the country.
Throughout the uprising, it has blamed the violence on terrorists serving a foreign conspiracy. It has yet to comment on the April 10 deadline, though Mr. Annan and Russian officials have said it has accepted it.
The regime has accepted other peace plans in the past only to ignore them on the ground.
The violence has taken a high toll on civilians, and the International Committee of the Red Cross is pressing Syria to give aid workers access to embattled areas. The group's president, Jakob Kellenberger, visited Daraa province Wednesday with a team that distributed around 1,000 food baskets, said spokesman Saleh Dabbakeh.
Mr. Kellenberger hasn't commented publicly since he arrived on Monday.
