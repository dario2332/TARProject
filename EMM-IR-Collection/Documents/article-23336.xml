  <text>Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng, whose case overshadowed high-level U.S.-China talks
earlier this month, is headed to New York City after a flight
Chen, who is blind, arrived at New Jersey’s Newark Liberty
International Airport aboard United Continental Holdings Inc.
flight 88 from the Chinese capital.
His exit resolves a dispute that has complicated U.S.-China
relations since he turned up at the American embassy in Beijing
on April 26 after escaping detention in Shandong province. For
President Barack Obama, running for re-election, it puts to rest
an issue over which he has been berated by Republicans.
“I don’t know when I’ll come back, but I’ll definitely
come back,” Chen said in a telephone interview broadcast
earlier today by Hong Kong Cable Television.
The U.S. expressed its “appreciation for the manner in
which we were able to resolve this matter and support Mr. Chen’s
desire to study in the U.S. and pursue his goals,” according to
a statement today from State Department spokeswoman Victoria
“Americans across the country and people all over the
world are celebrating,” Representative Chris Smith, a New
Jersey Republican, said at the airport where he arrived to greet
Smith has championed Chen’s case, and Chen twice called
from his Beijing hospital room to Congressional hearings held by
Smith to draw attention to his case.
“The beatings are over: The abuse and the psychological
trauma,” Smith said. “Just because Chen Guangcheng is free,
not all of the Chens are free,” he told more than a dozen
reporters from around the world. “There are a large number of
family members, his brother and nephew, who now remain at great
risk of retaliation.”
A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing
wasn’t immediately available to comment on Chen’s case. Attempts
to reach Chen before the aircraft’s departure were unsuccessful.
“We are relieved that the Chinese government has respected
Chen Guangcheng and his family’s legal rights to travel
overseas,” Phelim Kine, senior Asia researcher for New York-
based Human Rights Watch, said by telephone. “Chen isn’t just
one guy, he is a symbol of thousands and thousands of other
people who are trying to exercise their legal rights to seek
change in what is, in many ways, an abusive status quo.”
Chen was imprisoned for four years and then was kept under
house arrest in Shandong province after initiating a class-
action lawsuit against forced abortions and sterilizations
involving village women.
The activist escaped his confinement last month and fled to
Beijing, where he was given shelter at the U.S. embassy days
before Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner arrived for annual talks on U.S.-China
Negotiations over Chen’s future drew attention to human-
rights violations and threatened to derail the high-level
meeting. After initially departing the embassy with a Chinese
promise that he would be allowed to live freely in China, Chen
said he had changed his mind and wanted to go to the U.S.
A deal was reached for Chen to apply for a passport and
accept an offer to study law at New York University.
“I look forward to welcoming him and his family tonight,
and to working with him on his course of study,” Jerome A.
Cohen, co-director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at the New
York University School of Law, said today in an e-mailed
