  <text>PanARMENIAN.Net -  Special envoy Kofi Annan said Wednesday, April 11 in Tehran that Iran could help solve the crisis in Syria, where activists reported fresh violence near the capital Damascus a day before an international cease-fire is supposed to take effect, AP reported.
Iran has opposed any foreign intervention in the crisis and Salehi insisted that "change in Syria" should come under the leadership of Assad.
But Annan insists there is still time to salvage the truce by 6 a.m. Thursday, the deadline for government and rebel fighters to cease all hostilities.
The most interesting thing in Annan’s plan is that it does not call for Bashar al-Assad to leave power.
