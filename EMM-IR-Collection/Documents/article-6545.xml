  <text>Syrian troops and tanks battled rebels today, opposition activists said, only four days before a troop pullback agreed by president Bashar al-Assad as part of international envoy Kofi Annan's plan to end a year of bloodshed.
The renewed violence erupted a day after UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said the conflict was worsening and attacks on civilian areas persisted, despite assurances from Damascus that its troops had begun withdrawing under the plan.
UN-Arab League mediator Mr Annan said "more far-reaching action is urgently required" to halt all forms of violence by April 12th, following a withdrawal of the military's heavy weapons and troops from cities two days earlier.
But activists reported tank fire in at least three urban centres today - the town of Douma near Damascus, the restive city of Homs and Rastan, north of Homs.
"Tanks went into Douma last night, then they left. Today at seven in the morning they came back. There has been shelling on Douma since the morning. We are not sure if people were killed but the shelling did not stop," a local activist said.
"At least five tanks and 10 buses loaded with security men and Shabiha (pro-Assad militia) entered Douma," he said.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops were fighting Free Syrian Army rebels in Douma as well as in Rastan on the highway between Homs and Hama cities.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Army shelling of villages in the northwestern province of Idlib has prompted a swelling exodus of Syrian refugees. More than 2,800 fled into Turkey yesterday, a Turkish official said, more than double the highest previous one-day total.
The refugees all crossed close to the Turkish village of Bukulmez and more were waiting on the other side of the border, the official said. Forty-four minibuses ferried the arrivals from the border to a refugee camp at Reyhanli.
"The army is destroying buildings and bombing them till they turn to charcoal," said Mohammed Khatib, a refugee who said he came from Kastanaz, a Syrian town of 20,000 people.
"The army wants people to move out of their houses. If the residents refuse, they destroy them with the people inside."
More than 42,000 Syrians have fled their country since the revolt against 42 years of Assad family rule began a year ago. Loyalist forces have killed over 9,000 people, by a UN tally. Syria says 6,044 have died, including 2,566 soldiers and police.
Mr Annan told the UN General Assembly by video link from Geneva that the Syrian authorities had told him this week troop withdrawals were under way in the towns of Deraa, Idlib and Zabadani. But he said he wanted "fuller information".
Western powers are not convinced Dr Assad will honour the promised truce and believe he may seek loopholes giving him more time to cripple the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and deter protesters.
It is also uncertain whether the FSA has enough control over its fighters to enforce Mr Annan's ceasefire deadline.
Syria's UN ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, said the plan did not require any pullback of police - who have played a big role in the conflict as suggested by the state's own casualty toll.
Last year the opposition said troops had disguised themselves as police and repainted army vehicles in police colours before the arrival in December of Arab observers sent to monitor what proved an abortive Arab League peace plan.
A Norwegian general attached to UN peacekeeping arrived in Damascus yesterday to examine prospects for an eventual UN ceasefire monitoring mission of up to 250 unarmed observers, something which would require a Security Council resolution.
The council, where Russia and China have vetoed two previous Syria resolutions, agreed yesterday to a statement urging Damascus to meet Mr Annan's ceasefire deadline.
