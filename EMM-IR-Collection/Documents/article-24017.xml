  <text>The National News Agency reported on Sunday that an “armed convoy” carrying Lebanese citizen Shiekh Ahmad Abdel Wahid to the northern Lebanese town of Halba to participate in a rally refused to stop at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Akkar.
The report added that the Lebanese army opened fire when the convoy failed to stop, which led to the death of Sheikh Abdel Wahid and a bodyguard identified as Mohammad Hussein Merheb, both from the town of Al-Beri.
The Lebanese army later issued a statement saying a “tragic incident” took place at an army checkpoint in the northern Lebanese village of Koueikhat in Akkar during which Abdel Wahid and his bodyguard were shot and killed.
The army offered its condolences to the families of the victims and said that it immediately formed a committee comprised of high-ranking military officers to investigate the incident.
MTV earlier cited an unnamed security source as saying that shots were fired at the Lebanese army, but that the army did not open fire on Abdel Wahid.
Two separate rallies are expected to take place today in Halba to commemorate those who were killed during the May 7, 2008 clashes.
One rally was organized by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), and the other by families of some people who were allegedly killed by SSNP members.
