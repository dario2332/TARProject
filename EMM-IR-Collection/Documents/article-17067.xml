  <text>The deaths are said to have occurred during an offensive to retake the area from the Free Syrian Army.
"Shells and rockets have been hitting the town since 3am at a rate of one a minute. Rastan has been destroyed," a Free Syrian Army member in the town, 25 kms north of the city of Homs, told Reuters.
Activists said that Syrian troops backed by armoured vehicles yesterday shot dead seven civilians when they overran the rebellious Sunni Muslim village of Tamanaa in al-Ghab, burning houses and arresting dozens of people.
Its defiance had angered the inhabitants of a nearby Alawite village called al-Aziziyeh, a recruiting ground for a militia loyal to Assad, which participated in a separate assault on Tamanaa on Friday, the activists said.
Tensions between the two villages had risen after militia men from al-Aziziyeh killed two youths in Tamanaa on Friday after opening fire on an anti-Assad demonstration there.
