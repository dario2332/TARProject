  <text>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is unlikely to re-open supply routes to Nato troops in Afghanistan unless the United States offers a politically acceptable formula in talks on ending a six-month standoff on the issue, a Pakistani official said on Thursday.
“It is not fair for any country to expect any decisions that could be politically harmful ahead of elections,” the official, who is familiar with the negotiations, told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The United States has been pushing Pakistan to re-open supply routes to Nato forces in Afghanistan in difficult talks that show no signs of a breakthrough any time soon.
Pakistan was demanding a substantially higher fee than the current $250 per container or per fuel truck that crosses its borders and it was not clear when a deal was possible, he said, without elaborating. “It could be tomorrow or it could be in two months,” said the official.
US frustrations with Pakistan deepened on Wednesday after Pakistani authorities sentenced a doctor accused of helping the CIA find Osama bin Laden to 33 years in jail on charges of treason.
Shakil Afridi was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign, in which he collected DNA samples, that is believed to have helped the American intelligence agency track down bin Laden in a Pakistani town.
The al Qaeda leader was killed in a unilateral US special forces raid in the town of Abbottabad in May last year that heavily damaged ties with Washington, a source of billions of dollars in aid.
Pakistani officials deny this and say an intelligence gap enabled bin Laden to live here undetected.
No one has yet been charged for helping the al Qaeda leader take refuge in Pakistan.
A government commission tasked with investigating how he managed to evade capture by Pakistani authorities for so long is widely accused of being ineffective.
AMERICAN OUTRAGE OVER SENTENCING
US officials and lawmakers said Afridi deserved only praise, not a 33-year jail sentence.
Two senior US senators called the ruling “shocking and outrageous” and urged Islamabad to pardon and release the doctor immediately.
Islamabad is sticking to demands for an American apology for the Pakistani soldiers killed in the air attack on the border, but progress has been made on the issue, said the Pakistani official.
“We need some sort of apology,” he said.
Pakistan also wants an end to US drone strikes on militants on its territory.
After conducting a review of ties with Washington last month, parliament called on the government to demand an end to drone strikes.
That, the official said, implies that Pakistan must itself expel foreign militants from its soil, including Uzbeks, Arabs and members of the Afghan Haqqani network, one of the most feared groups fighting US-led Nato forces in Afghanistan.
A US drone strike on suspected militants in the area on Thursday killed 10 people, Pakistani intelligence officials said, an attack likely to raise tensions in the standoff with Washington over Nato supply routes.
The pilotless drone aircraft attacked a compound in a village in North Waziristan, a day after a similar attack killed four suspected militants in the same region.
“The drone fired two missiles at the compound. We believe it was being used by militants,” one of the Pakistani officials said.
The United States has been urging Pakistan to mount an offensive in North Waziristan to pursue Haqqani militants.
Pakistan has said its military is stretched fighting homegrown Taliban militants, and some analysts doubt the army could defeat the group.
A full-fledged assault in North Waziristan looks more unlikely than ever, as a result of troubled ties between Washington and Islamabad, and Pakistan’s PPP-led government may want to put on a brave face in the supply route talks.
The administration is already deeply unpopular, with public frustrations growing over chronic power cuts, widespread poverty, unemployment and official corruption.
