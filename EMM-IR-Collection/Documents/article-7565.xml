  <text>"There is no more time to lose. We must all push for an end to the bloodshed before Syria plunges into the abyss.
"It is essential that the next 48 hours bring visible signs of immediate and indisputable change in the military posture of the government forces throughout the country."
Mr Annan said Syria had failed to send the "signal of peace" required by the plan, agreed to by president Bashar al Assad.
He said Syrian government forces have withdrawn from some cities, but now have new targets. He said a "fundamental change of course" by Mr Assad was needed to achieve a ceasefire.
"I am gravely concerned at the course of events," Mr Annan said in his letter.
"The days before 10 April should have been an opportunity for the government of Syria to send a powerful political signal of peace, with action on all aspects of the six-point (peace) plan."
He added the opposition should also cease fighting in order to "give no excuse for the government to renege on its commitments".
US ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, president of the council this month, said all council members voiced "deep concern" at Damascus's level of commitment to its truce pledges.
She was speaking to reporters after Mr Annan's deputy, Jean-Marie Guehenno, briefed the council via video link from Geneva.
Ms Rice added the council may soon face a "moment of  truth" when it will have to decide whether to increase pressure on Mr Assad.
Her remarks appeared to be aimed primarily at Russia and China, which have twice vetoed Western- and Arab-backed resolutions condemning Mr Assad's 13-month assault on pro-democracy protesters but have recently supported several council statements backing Mr Annan's six-point peace plan.
The US view is that it is outrageous but by no means unexpected or surprising that the (Syrian) government has yet again made commitments and broken them.
