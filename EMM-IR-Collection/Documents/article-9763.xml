The reports come two days after the ceasefire brokered by  international envoy Kofi Annan went into effect. The violence in  Syria since then has been much less than the daily norm of clashes  and shellings before the truce.
The regime restricts access of foreign observers, including  journalists, making it difficult to verify reports of violence  independently.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the  shelling lasted for about an hour today and there were no  reports of casualties.
Activist Tarek Badrakhan, who is based in the rebel-held Homs  neighbourhood of Khaldiyeh, and the Observatory said the shelling  targeted the neighborhoods of Jouret el-Shayah and Qarabees.
The shelling in Homs came as the United Nations Security Council  prepared to vote on a resolution authorising the deployment of the  first wave of UN military observers to monitor the ceasefire  between the Syrian Government and opposition fighters.
The truce is at the centre of Annan's peace plan, which is aimed  at ending more than a year of bloodshed that according to the UN  has killed over 9000 people. The plan then aims to launch inclusive  Syrian-led talks on the country's political future.
The uprising began last year with mostly peaceful protests  against the Assad family dynasty, which has ruled Syria for more  than four decades. But the government's violent crackdown fuelled  an armed insurgency as army defectors and protesters began fighting  back.
Yesterday, Syrian forces used live fire, tear gas and clubs to  beat back tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets  across the country in powerful and often jubilant displays of  defiance.
The Local Coordination Committees activist group said there were  771 demonstrations throughout Syria on Friday, a number that is  larger than the protests of the weeks before.
Activists said security forces killed at least six people yesterday, a lower-than-usual toll. The rallies, described as some of  the largest in months, stretched from the suburbs of Damascus to  the central province of Hama, Idlib in the north and the southern  province of Daraa, where the uprising began in March 2011.
The Observatory said today that troops were conducting a  wave of arrests in the Damascus suburb of Dumair when a car  exploded killing one civilian and wounding two others. It gave no  further details.
In Homs, which has been one of the hardest-hit areas in Syria in  the past 13 months and became the symbol of Syria's uprising, the  sporadic shelling started last night and continued into this morning, Badrakhan said.
"I can see black smoke billowing from a building that was hit in  Jouret el-Shayah," Badrakhan told The Associated Press via Skype.
