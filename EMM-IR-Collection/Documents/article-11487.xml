  <text>April 16, 2012 (KHARTOUM) – The Sudanese national assembly on Monday adopted a resolution designating the country’s southern neighbor as an enemy state in the latest sign of escalation between the two sides.
“We consider the government of South Sudan an enemy and Sudanese state institutions must treat it as such,” according to the text read by Kamal Obeid who chairs the defense and security committee in parliament.
The legislative body’s speaker Ahmed Ibrahim al-Taher also announced that his country wants the ruling party in South Sudan toppled by any means necessary.
"We declare that we will confront the [Sudan People Liberation Movement] SPLM until we end its rule of the South, and will work to gather our resources to realize this aim," al-Taher said.
"We are in a battle that does not finish with the recovery of Heglig, but with an end to the danger that comes from South Sudan” he added.
It remains unclear what implications the decision will carry as the power to declare war lies with the president according to the constitution. Only then can the parliament endorse it according to the 2005 constitution.
The two countries are now engaged in what some observers now classify as a full blown war since last Tuesday when South Sudan’s army occupied the oil-rich region of Heglig in South Kordofan state.
The surprise occupation reignited claims made by South Sudanese officials that Heglig is part of their country and specifically Unity state.
Juba’s move drew wide international condemnation but has yet to convince Juba to initiate a withdrawal. South Sudan laid out a set of conditions for that including stopping aerial bombardments, withdrawing Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) from Abyei and Khartoum pledging not to use Heglig as a base to attack South Sudan.
In the alternative, South Sudan suggested the deployment of UN peacekeepers in Heglig.
Sudanese president Omer Hassan al-Bashir told the visiting Egyptian foreign minister Mohamed Kamel Amr this week that there will be no negotiations without a withdrawal.
The Sudanese parliament also approved a formal response to minister of defense’s testimony last week in which it called for a clear national strategy in dealing with South Sudan, strengthening internal front, supporting the armed forces, conducting dialogue with non-SPLM political powers in South Sudan, announcing comprehensive mobilization and amending the country’s budget.
The response also reiterated the suspension of all negotiations except for military ones aimed at expelling South Sudan from the occupied territories.
The national assembly also stressed that the term “Liberation of Sudan” should never be used in connection with the name of any political organization as it will be considered a hostile act.
The decision of Sudanese Parliament is immature,childish,unstudied,decided by wrong people in the wrong place.This decision tell us that u(Southerners) draw your border by bullets,we are no longer friends.Gallant SPLA is capable in drawing our border.

I can clearly see that South Sudanese can indeed forget their internal differences to focus on national issues in unison.
Bravo my brothers for all the brilliant comments and support to our armed forces (SPLA).
I hope our leaders see how the whole nation is behind them now and never disappoint us.

@ Chok Deng you vey right, everything is emptied even the Islamic slogan of Allah uak bhar( God is great) has diminishing.
The entire citizens of N.Sudan are very nervous of where they should refuge if our gallant fighters advance a head while untrained soldiers are being hospitalized of diarrohea due to fear and lack of frontline experiences.But not yet our forces are coming with more lessons

This resolution is an indication that Sudan is a real terriorist state ready to harm South Sudanese and their government because of the resources in the South. But will Sudanese really belief on this resolution? It is NCP propaganda nothing else. This is a typical jalaba hatred manifested in government. South Sudan is only defending itself. Let Beshir go, that resolution will fade in the air.

SPLM should ask them this simple question. Can a really friend charge you $36 dollar per barrel? Can a really friend bomb civillians &amp;; oil facilities because you refuse to their demand? Can your really friend steal from you?.
