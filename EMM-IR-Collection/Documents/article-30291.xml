  <text>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) &amp;mdash; Syrian security forces on Friday killed at least 50 civilians, including 13 children, in central Syria, activists said, in one of the highest daily death tolls in one region since an internationally brokered cease-fire went into effect last month.

Syrian troops, using tanks, mortar shells and heavy machine guns, pounded the area of Houla, a region made up of several towns and villages in the province of Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain, and the Local Coordination Committees.
Both activist organizations said that at least 50 people were killed. The Observatory for Human Rights, said the dead included 13 children. It also said that about 100 people were wounded.
An amateur video posted online by activists showed more than a dozen bodies lined up inside a room. They included about 10 children who were covered with sheets that allowed only their bloodied faces to be seen.
"Houla was subjected to a massacre," a man could be heard saying inside the room.
In Houla, a family of six was killed when their home took a direct hit, the Observatory for Human Rights said.
Homs has been among the hardest hit provinces in the crackdown by the government of President Bashar al-Assad since the uprising began in March 2011. The United Nations said several weeks ago that 9,000 people had been killed in Syria in the last 15 months. Hundreds more have died since.
Attacks like those on Friday, as well as strikes by rebel forces on government troops, have persisted despite the deployment of more than 250 United Nations observers who have fanned out across Syria to monitor the cease-fire brokered by Kofi Annan, the United Nations and Arab League special envoy for Syria.
In the northern city of Aleppo, Syrian forces fired tear gas and live ammunition on Friday to disperse thousands of protesters who had been calling for Mr. Assad's ouster, activists said, adding that five people were killed.
In another development, a group of Lebanese Shiites who were kidnapped in Syria on Tuesday were released on Friday. They had been abducted by gunmen as they returned from a religious pilgrimage.
The kidnappings fueled fears that Lebanon was being drawn further into the bloody conflict in neighboring Syria. In the hours after the pilgrims were abducted, protests erupted in Beirut's Shiite-dominated southern suburbs, with residents burning tires and blocking roads.
Prime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon confirmed that the men had been released, saying that they were "in good health and on their way to Beirut."
