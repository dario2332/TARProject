  <text>Future bloc leader MP Fouad Siniora said on Sunday that there was a conspiracy aimed to drag Lebanese people into a confrontation with the army.
“[Last week], Lebanese citizen Shadi al-Mawlawi was arrested in Tripoli to [cause problems] in the city. Today, Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed was killed at a Lebanese army checkpoint. This is a strife that we will not be dragged into,” Siniora said in a statement.
“Conspirators are trying to drag the residents into a confrontation with the army which is supposed to protect the [residents],” Siniora, who condemned the murder of Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, added.
He also said that the incident’s circumstances should be “revealed as soon as possible,” adding that “Sheikh Ahmad’s blood will not be wasted.”
“We must know who stands behind the crime, who planned it and who gave the orders [to open fire at the sheikh] because what happened makes us suspicious that there is someone [planning something] evil for Lebanon,” the former premier said and called for a “quick and immediate investigation.”
“[We] completely trust the army and [we] therefore have to support it more than before because the army and its role are targeted [in order] to [eventually harm] the state and the country,” Siniora added.
Army troops shot dead Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. -NOW Lebanon
