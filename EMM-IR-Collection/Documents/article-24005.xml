  <text>Sunni Sheikh Ahmad Rifai warned on Sunday that if relevant authorities did not work to solve the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed, the sheikhs in Akkar will have to form a “Free Lebanese Army,” the National News Agency reported.
“[We] call on the army command, Prime Minister [Najib Mikati] and the [relevant] figures to work quickly to solve the case because if not so the sheikhs will have to form a Free Lebanese Army [since] it is unacceptable for the situation to remain as such,” Rifai, who was speaking on behalf of a delegation of Akkar sheikhs, said.
“People [in Akkar] will not calm down. We are not used to living in humiliation. We are not used to [having] our dignities insulted,” Rifai added.
He also requested Higher Defense Council Secretary General Adnan Merheb, also a major general and “a friend” of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed, to call on the council to take a position.
“We call on them to bring us our rights because what happened was an attack on… the Islamic nation and its sons. Everyone must understand this and forewarned is forearmed.”
Army troops shot dead Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. -NOW Lebanon
