  <text>A team of UN observers deployed in Syria to monitor a truce in place since April 12 arrived on Saturday in the town of Houla, site of a "massacre" by regime forces in which at least 90 people died, monitors said.
"A team of UN observers arrived in the village of Taldau [on the outskirts of] Houla, to document the crimes committed in the past 24 hours, in violation of the ceasefire," said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Syrian regime forces have "massacred" more than 90 people, including 25 children, in Houla, in the central province of Homs, the Britain-based watchdog said.
The violence caused residents to flee for safety, the monitoring group noted. "Many people are fleeing Taldau village in Houla," the Observatory said, adding that residents feared new attacks on the town, in the central province of Homs.
The Observatory reported that "blasts" were heard in Taldahab, very near Taldau, while the monitors were on the outskirts of Houla.
State news agency SANA reported the UN monitors' arrival in Houla, adding that they had also visited the Sultaniya and Jobar districts of Homs city and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent offices there.
SANA blamed "armed terrorist groups" for the killings in Houla, adding that "clashes led to the killing of several terrorists and the martyrdom of several members of the special forces."
More than 12,600 people have been killed in Syria since a revolt against President Bashar al-Assad's rule broke out in March 2011, including nearly 1,500 since a UN-backed truce took effect on April 12, according to the Observatory.
