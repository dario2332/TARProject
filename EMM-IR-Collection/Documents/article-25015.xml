A Yemeni soldier dressed in uniform blew himself up in the middle of an army battalion in Sanaa on Monday, killing at least 96 people and wounding dozens of others, a military official and medics said.
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the blast which according to witnesses was heard across the city, causing panic among residents.
An AFP correspondent said dozens of ambulances rushed to evacuate the dead and wounded, as security forces cordoned off the area.
It remains unclear if the parade will take place as planned.
Since the offensive began, 213 people have been killed, according to a tally compiled by AFP, including 147 al-Qaida fighters, 31 military personnel, 18 local militiamen and 17 civilians.
The offensive followed days after the White House announced that a plot by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to blow up a U.S. airliner had been foiled.
It said a double agent spent weeks with AQAP before handing over information allowing the United States to launch a drone strike on May 6 that killed Fahd al-Quso, a senior figure wanted for the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.
