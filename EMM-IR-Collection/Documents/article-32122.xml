China has condemned a massacre of more than 100 people in the central Syrian town of Houla and called for an immediate investigation to identify those responsible. The foreign ministry says it is "deeply shocked" by the killings and has urged the swift implementation of UN-Arab envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan, a day after the United Nations condemned the Syrian regime's use of artillery in Houla. But Beijing has stopped short of pointing the finger directly at the Syrian government, after Russia questioned whether Damascus was behind the violence. "China is deeply shocked and strongly condemns the incident," said foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin. "China... calls for an immediate investigation into this issue and to find the perpetrators. This incident again shows that Syria should waste no time to implement the ceasefire and end the violence," he added. Beijing and Moscow - both long-standing allies of Damascus - drew international criticism earlier this year for vetoing two UN Security Council resolutions against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. They have since backed Annan's efforts to bring peace to Syria. But the peace envoy's six-point blueprint, which was supposed to begin with a ceasefire from April 12, has been broken daily. Russia blames 'both sides'Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Moscow was deeply alarmed by the massacre in Houla but that both President Bashar al-Assad's government and rebels were to blame. "We are dealing with a situation in which both sides evidently had a hand in the deaths of innocent people," Mr Lavrov said on Monday. He says Moscow does not support the government of Mr Assad but he urged world powers to work for the peace plan of Mr Annan and not regime change.Human rights group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says more than 13,000 people have been killed in Syria since an anti-regime revolt broke out in March 2011.
