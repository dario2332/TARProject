  <text>Brazil on Monday hailed as a "positive development" Syria's conditional acceptance of international observers to monitor violence as part of an Arab League plan.
"We favor diplomacy and if that implies a supra-regional mechanism, we will support these efforts with a view toward ending the escalation of violence and creating conditions for a political solution," the state Agencia Brasil quoted Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota as saying.
Brazil holds a non-permanent seat on the 15-member UN Security Council until the end of the month.
Syria said earlier it conditionally accepts observers, as a rights group reported militiamen loyal to the regime killed 34 civilians and dumped their bodies in a city square.
The Arab League, which has threatened to impose new sanctions on Damascus if it fails to comply with the plan for monitors, said it was considering the Syrian offer to allow them into the troubled country.
Syria had initially refused to sign an Arab proposal to send in observers to monitor its forces accused of rights violations by the UN, which says that more than 4,000 people have been killed since March in a protest crackdown.
