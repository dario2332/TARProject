(CBS/AP) As activists reported a fresh bombardment in the central city of Hama, United Nations special envoy Kofi Annan called on the Syrian government and "everyone with a gun" to stop the violence that left more than a 100 dead in the past few days.
"I urge the government to take bold steps to signal that it is serious in its intention to resolve this crisis peacefully, and for everyone involved to help create the right context for a credible political process. And this message of peace is not only for the government, but for everyone with a gun," Annan said.
Annan arrived in Syria on Monday, just days after a gruesome weekend massacre that killed more than 100 people.
"It is the Syrian people, ordinary citizens of this great country, who are paying the highest price in this conflict. Our goal is to stop this suffering. It must end and it must end now," Annan said.
Syrian troops shelled several neighborhoods in Hama until the early hours of Monday, killing at least 24 people, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees activist group said. Amateur videos showed a makeshift hospital where several people lay on the floor either dead or wounded. Further details were not immediately clear.
