  <text>TRIPOLI/BEIRUT: Two Muslim preachers were killed Sunday in Akkar, north Lebanon, after shots were fired at their vehicle at a Lebanese Army checkpoint which prompted the military to withdraw its forces from the region.
Sheikh Ahmad Abdel-Wahed and his companion, Sheikh Mohammad Hussein al-Mereb, were killed at an army checkpoint in Kwaikhat while they were on route to a planned rally organized by MP Khaled Daher in Halba to commemorate the killing of Future Movement supporters during clashes in 2008.
Following the incident, Daher canceled the rally, which had been scheduled to run alongside a rival rally by the Syrian Nationalist Socialist Party (SSNP) to commemorate their members who were slain in the 2008 clashes.
The circumstances surrounding the killing of the two preachers remain unclear.
In a statement, the army expressed its deepest regrets over the incident in which the two men "were killed after sustaining gunshot wounds."
"[The army] immediately took the initiative to form an investigative committee of senior officers and military police under the supervision of the relevant judiciary," the army said.
The army pulled out its military vehicles from Akkar and returned to its barracks in the northern area of Andaqit as gunmen were seen in the areas of Bireh and Qobeiyat.
Residents, angered over the killings, blocked roads and burned tires in several areas of Akkar, including Abdeh, as well as area Malluleh, near the northern entrance to the northern coastal city of Tripoli.
Lebanon's second largest city, Tripoli, became the scene of deadly clashes last week between supporters and detractors of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The clashes, which led to the death of 11 and wounding of scores more, were brought to a halt after heavy army deployment in the area.
An hour after the incident in Akkar, a man identifying himself by the first name of Khaled who claimed to be the preacher's chauffeur, told local media that an army soldier had shot Abdel-Wahed after the latter attempted to drive away from the checkpoint.
The chauffeur said the army had been notified that the convoy would be passing through the checkpoint.
Upon arrival at the checkpoint, the man said several soldiers had waved them through but one soldier demanded that the preacher step out of the car.
Following a verbal altercation with the soldier, the man said he stepped out of the vehicle, when Abdel-Wahed took the driver's seat and turned the vehicle around to go back. The soldiers then fired at the vehicle, killing the sheikh, he added.
Prime Minister Najib Mikati, in reaction to the killings, called for an investigative committee into the case.
A statement from his office also said Mikati telephoned Daher to express his condolences over the death of Abdel-Wahed and said he hoped everyone would play a positive role in calming the situation down and resolving the matter wisely.
Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, the head of the Future Movement, condemned the killing and said it was clear "that there is a plan to destabilize some Lebanese regions and drag specific problems to them to serve the Syrian regime and its tools."
"We do not blame the Lebanese army as a whole for the murder ... But it is clear that some people involved in this murder want to use the institution and its symbol to import the crisis of the Syrian regime with its people and the whole world, to Lebanon, in a desperate attempt to save it from its unavoidable end," he said in a statement.
Hariri contacted President Michel Sleiman and Lebanese Army head Gen. Jean Kahwagi and demanded that they launch a commission to investigate the incident and hold those responsible, "no matter how high their rank," to account.
MP Daher, who held a news conference outside his party's office following the incident, urged the army to punish the "officers" who shot at Abdel-Wahed.
"The army and its intelligence have always played a negative role in the [northern] region," Daher said, accusing the government of acting as "an agent" for Damascus.
Abdul-Wahed was a member of the Bireh's municipality and he was a candidate from the union of municipalities in Dreeb, Akkar.
