Syrian Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari denied his government had anything to do 
  with the killings after the UN Security Council unanimously condemned 
  President Bashar al-Assad's regime for the heavy-weapons attacks on the 
  town, which reportedly left 108 people dead, many of them children.
Ja'afari dismissed what he termed as the "tsunami of lies" of the 
  British, French and German envoys, who lined up to blame the Syrian 
  government for the attack.
Earlier the council had issued a statement which was read out after a 
  three-hour emergency meeting by Azerbaijan's deputy UN ambassador Tofig 
"The Security Council condemned in the strongest possible terms the 
  killings, confirmed by United Nations observers, of dozens of men, women and 
  children and the wounding of hundreds more in the village of (Houla), near 
  Homs, in attacks that involved a series of government artillery and tank 
  shellings on a residential neighbourhood," the non-binding statement 
The head of the UN observer mission in Syria General Robert Mood briefed the 
  15-nation council on the massacre as he spoke via a video link from

A letter to the Security Council from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also 
  confirmed that UN observers had "viewed the bodies of the dead and 
  confirmed from an examination of ordnance that artillery and tank shells 
  were fired at a residential neighbourhood."
After the meeting, British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant pointed to the 
  bombardment by government artillery and tanks as the cause of the killings.
"The Security Council has made it abundantly clear through its 
  resolutions that there are no circumstances whatsoever that justify the use 
  of heavy weapons and tanks against civilian population," he said.
"Those weapons and tanks should have been returned to their barracks 
"So, it does not matter, to be honest, what the exact circumstances in 
  the run up to this atrocity was. The fact is that it is an atrocity, and it 
  was perpetrated by the Syrian government."
Russian Deputy UN Ambassador Alexander Pankin said Moscow was sceptical about 
  suggestions that the Syrian government had been behind the massacre, saying 
  it appeared most of the victims were killed with knives or shot at
