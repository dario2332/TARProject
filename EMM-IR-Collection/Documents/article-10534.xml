  <text>DERA ISMAIL KHAN / BANNU / PESHAWAR: More than 200 heavily armed Taliban militants travelling in several vehicles attacked the Central Jail in Bannu, Southern District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, releasing 384 prisoners in a pre-dawn assault on Sunday, officials said.
The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) claimed responsibility for raiding the jail. TTP spokesperson Asimullah Mehsud told The Express Tribune from an undisclosed location that they (TTP) attacked the jail with hundreds of fighters. “The purpose was to free some of our men”, he said, adding “we attacked with 150 Fidaeen (suicide bombers) and took over the area for more than two hours.”
Four police officials who were injured in the attack were taken to the District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ). Another policeman on guard at the main gate of the police station said that dozens of the militants were in vehicles and hundreds of them were on foot carrying Ak-47s and rocket launchers.  “The gate was rooted out after one fired a rocket at it” he explained. Residents of the area said militants had destroyed the boundary wall to aid in their escape.
A large number of militants had recently been moved to the jail from neighbouring Kohat and Lakki Marwat prisons, which are being converted into centres to rehabilitate former insurgents, the security official said.
A senior official of the Township Police station told The Express Tribune that the FIR registered says that hundreds of militants attacked the Bannu central jail around 1:15am and 384 prisoners were released. He said, ‘Some of them are men that are most wanted’.
Explaining the category of the militants that managed to escape, the official said there were 20 men who were facing death sentences and are very dangerous.
Officials believe that the attacker’s main aim was to release Adnan Rashid, a former junior technician of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), allegedly involved in plotting the murder of former president Parvez Musharraf. Inspector General Police, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (IG) Akbar Khan Hoti, said that the whole plan seemed to have been for the release of the top militant.
A police official from the central jail, on condition of anonymity said that the militants entered the premises of the jail after firing hand grenades and rockets and the only question they asked was “Where is Adnan?”
“They spoke different languages” he claimed, adding that “their attire was typical to the Taliban with boots, grown hair and loaded with arms.”
An investigative officer said that there was English and Arabic jihadi literature recovered from the cell where Adnan was kept, along with other important evidence. He refrained from giving further details.
Adnan Rashid joined PAF as a junior technician in 1997. Security officials apprehended him from Balochistan in 2004 in connection with a plot to assassinate Musharraf. Sources said that he was shifted from Kohat to Bannu Jail some eigth months ago.  Amongst the prisoners is also Aijaz, a militant who had previously managed to escape from the same jail. The names of the rest of the ‘most wanted’ could not be ascertained immediately.
Now I understand, how our incompetence has forced America to use drones in our country.
No need to blame outsiders, we are solely responsible for the destruction and downfall of our beautiful country.
this is heart breaking.. shoot on sight order for TTP!! Dragonian laws are needed..I am shocked!! another wave of suicide blasts awaiting us?
Isnt this a repetition of what happened last year? Firstly, in last 12 years, not a single person is tried in court or punished. Shamefully, people like Hafiz Syeed and Quadri are moving freely in the society creating trouble and spoiling the name of the country. Atleast we should have proper prisons to keep these guys inside, if the courts have failed to deliver justice.
More than 150 heavily-armed militants
  stormed the central prison outside the
  restive northwestern town of Bannu
So this is why they were moved from Kohat jail to Bannu.
The whole drill of arresting terrorists and militants by the law enforcing agencies has come to square one due to inadequate security at the Bannu Jail which led to make the escape easy for 384 prisoners.
The authorities should review and investigate the whole scenario and make necessary arrangements to me fool proof arrangements not at Bannu Jail but all the jails in the country, so that a similar incident should not occur again any where in the country, besides arresting the escaped prisoners.
What a shame? Why should we not believe that almost everything including the nuclear facilities are susceptible to similar militant operations?
Intelligence agencies are supporting the terrorists and giving them prior knowledge, funding and training for attacks.Recommend
Its all pre planned and everyone is involved.
This is very worrying. How can 150 heavily armed men move around in a country.Where were the law enforcement personnel.?. This is very serious.Is the country heading for a anarchy?
inside job.Recommend
How much man-hours and public money has been utilized in imprisoning the wrong-doers and everything is lost.  The burden falls on the tax-paying citizen, who is the ultimate loser, as always happens.
And no one died? Meaning no one fought back. Wow. Amusement! Amusement!
All escapees are hereby requested to please contact DPC or PTI offices and sign membership forms. Thanks.
“We attacked the Bannu prison and got our special members freed,” Ehsan told AFP
Conspiracy theory should start work now. CIA,RAW.Moosad  are behind thisact
I read something quoted below about the current situation in Pakistan:
This was the land where first university of the world was established in the city now called Taxila centuries before the advent of Islam or Christianity.
This is bad. This will serve as precedent for many more attempts in the future. On a side note, it does seem like a planned and coordinated move.
Just incredible gloom.
I fear for many innocent Pakistani lives, especially minorities.
But really they are in the thousands and have armies and can literally take over settled towns and cities like Swat and can wreck havoc brutally. Let alone perhaps many more ideological sympathizers and apologists who share their violent hate, even in our establishments, who literally aid them and sabotage anti-terrorism efforts.
The civil war is still on going.
For what we should be proud of our Army and ISI ? For their failure and humiliations or their empty words to be the best in world. They are taking lions share in Pakistani budget with ZERO out put. All these years they fooled us by scaring from India and keep filling their our pockets and maintain their hegemony. Its complete failure of ISI and other agencies whats happening in country. They are sheltering and promoting like DPC to defend us as they cant defend us any more. They are handing over goats to hungry barbarians to defend. May Allah protect this country and its lovely people.
Thanks to the judiciary for handing over of the terrorists to the civilian setups to ensure their sacred human rights.
Thousands of soldiers who laid their lives in arresting them have been betrayed.  Years of toil, blood  sweat and resources have gone down the drain .
People are not safe anywhere in Pakistan, not even in the prisons or GHQ.
Where was QRF (Quick Reaction Force sitting at Bannu Fort) ? Where were the cobra chopers sitting in the Bannu Fort. This is a shame for our security forces. If they could not respond to the attack in settled area how can we believe that they will respond well in violent areas. Lot of murderers and militanst were in the jail and they escaped. If LEA would have responded quickly it was also not possible for those 150 people to escape.
I think Pakistanis should stop blaming their military, mullahs, politicians and start blaming themselves.
It was claimed that 11 persons were sprung out of Adiala prison by TTP associates.Turned out to be different.
Repeat of the same story?
How easy is to bark and rebuke some powerful entity without disclosing one identity Mr. Pollock.
Come up with your assets and let the world know who is more stronger. Otherwise keep your mouth shut and enjoy the game
It represents worse civil administration and weak police authorities. Pakistan army is paying for all this,Army has captured these militants while sacrificing worth lives and carrying tough operations.put army one side and one can imagine,these miscreants are going to capture whole country.Recommend
Why were so many being kept together in prison. They should all have been killed for their treason.
The attack on Bannu Jail is an eye opener for all th law enforcing agencies to look for thier weaknesses and short falls. There may be more such like attacks, in some other areas, where even you just cant expect. the war on terror by USA has put the Pakistan in a dangerous position where by the inteernal threat is more severe then the external threat. If Pakistan chooses a straight approach, what the majority of the people says, May be there is a better solution. USA dictations will never deliver good for the countries occupied by them.
Pakistan has become an anarchy.
Translation: US hurt our fragile little feelings.
As passing through the road I observed several times that only some policemen were standing in front of the door alongwith a old vintage datsun. We have never seen any special security measure for this Jail. They were totally depending on the high walls of the jail. Also this jail is outside the city in open area. If someone have responded quickly especially with the help of Cobra Chopers, it was not even possible for these 150 people to escape. With the help of NVG they could become an easy target for the chopper and then there was no need to provide proofs to our honored courts that they were militants. They are killers of Pakistanis especially Pashtoons which they admit in front of media.
Once again our intelligence agencies and the security apparatus for this area failed and failed miserably!!!Recommend
Adnan Rashid, of PA convicted for the failed attempt to murder Musharaff had also, escaped the Bannu jail.
I think its a inside job.  Otherwise, what were the Army &amp;; FC  doing when the Bannu Jail is less than 15 kms away?  The attack continued for 2 hours &amp;; easily the forces could have intercepted if they wanted. Bannu is also heavily fortified and i just dont understand why &amp;; how could it happen.
Also note that none of Guards have been killed. So, there definitely is something we really dont know.
I think now, jamat Islami will blame, MQM involve in this incident also..haha
@Ch Allah Daad: best comment ever
So when is the government announcing subsidy on suicide jackets?
Hope they did not escape on donkeys since they left quite a few behind to guard the remains.
It would be naive not to expect a few dozen blasts or suicide hits in the near future. Hit list would of course be police, armed forces, ANP and Sherpao to say the least and mere mortals called innocent civilians.Recommend
This is ridiculous. Terrorist just came and freed almost 400 of their comrades from a highly fortified prison without killing even a single security guard!
Perhaps, this is the only incident of its kind in the world.
Totally shocking!. I had to rub my eyes twice to believe it was true,This is akin to a big slap on the face of the Pakistani security agencies and all of the effort has been thrown  to the winds,While involvement of the jail administration can not be ruled out,we have to accept that the operational capacity and capability of the militants are far superior than our security forces,The arms and ammunition possessed by militants simply outclass those entitled  to Police ,This is a major major setback.When will we start inducting more  resources in to the police department who has been entrusted with the responsibility of our security.This incident demands an inquiry and those involved must not be spared,having said that i believe this is the high time we  must strengthen our Police,make them a model,induct resources and sophisticated tools,Police must acquire state of the art machinery and tools to combat terrorism,until then we will have to live under the threat of annihilation.
Force vs Force, Power vs Power, Arms vs Arms = No End, No Peace
Falling apart, one incident at a time. The security agencies are useless. Waste of money.
national assets cannot be caged in- its a zaid hamidian/pakistanian truth
Agree with you! But this news is not funny at all! I am from Indian Hyderabad by the way!
On the next exciting episode of PRISON BREAK
The agencies are more concerned about the raid at night that caught Osama than the raid at night that set loose 400 inmates.
Chill out, he will handle them.
its a senseless approach you have, try to make your thoughts able to think broad. it will be good for the country to think for its interest instead of criticizing someone like you did here.   @Muhammad Rizwan Ali:
Time has come for Pak army to withdraw from FATA. Let the people of FATA decide how they want to live.
even bin laden was not safe in pakistan.
start search operation.
instead of finding how they escape find them.
Do not take it seriously. As per my intelligence all the prisoners have been directed by TTP to head directly to India. As per them , India gives VIP treatment to all terrorists like Kasab. No punishment, no harassment. Five star food etc. This seems to be a deal between Indian and Pakistani gov. of ongoing peace process.Recommend
@Ch. Allah Dad: Excellent comment! @Naveed Alam Khattak: Thank  you for your post.. Bannu fort with the army and all its resources, including choppers, is a short distance away. This whole prison break incident smells to high heaven and leads one to believe could not have been done without collusion from higher ups. And unfortunately the people who will bear the brunt will be innocent civillians. May Allah SWT keep them safe. Ameen.
