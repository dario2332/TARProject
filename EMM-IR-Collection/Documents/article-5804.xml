(CNN) -- Syria said Thursday that it had taken several steps to comply with a peace plan championed by U.N. envoy Kofi Annan, but opposition activists said regime assaults persisted, killing more than three dozen people around the country.
The government said that it had withdrawn troops from some cities and towns as part of the plan backed by Annan, the joint envoy to Syria from the Arab League and the United Nations, his spokesman said. The International Committee of the Red Cross also said it forged an agreement with the government for "an expanded presence."
World powers are trying to stop the bloody government crackdown launched against protesters in March 2011. Opponents of the regime and outside experts have said that the government has so far taken few tangible steps to implement the Annan plan, raising questions about its viability.
Annan's six-point plan calls for authorities to stop troop movement toward populated centers and end the use of heavy weapons. It urges a cease-fire by the government and the opposition, and a Syrian-led political process to end the crisis.
It implored the government to ensure "timely provision of humanitarian assistance" and intensify "the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons."
President Bashar al-Assad's regime has pledged to pull its troops out of cities by next Tuesday to comply with Annan's peace plan.
Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, said Thursday that Syria claimed to have pulled soldiers from Daraa in the south, Idlib in the north and Zabadani in the Damascus suburbs.
The claim could not immediately be confirmed. The United Nations was looking into it.
One resident, Abdulrahman Refaii of Herak in Daraa province told CNN he saw tanks around the city and smoke rising from the nearby town of Tayiba, more than a mile away.
Activists reported fierce government offensives continuing to rock the country. At least 37 people died on Thursday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The deaths occurred in Homs, Idlib, Hama, and the Damascus suburb town of Douma. In the Homs province town of Rastan, artillery shelling killed a 70-year-old man and three children, ages, 6, 8, and 16.
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it forged an agreement with the government for "an expanded presence."
"This agreement is a sign of trust in the ICRC's independent and netral humanitrain action," said ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger. "It should enable the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to meet increased humanitarian needs."
The entities agreed on a procedure "to trigger" a pause to deliver relief to fighting-plagued regions. The ICRC supported the idea, in Annan's plan, which calls for a "daily, two-hour humanitarian pause."
Also, the government "agreed on procedures for visits" to detention centers.
"The agreement will be put into practice with an ICRC visit to people held in Aleppo Central Prison," the ICRC said.
They discussed the right of those sick or injured to get medical care and for combatants "to respect medical personnel, facilities and transports."
The developments come as a U.N. advance team headed to Damascus to plan a cease-fire monitoring team. The "supervising and monitoring" mission would be comprised of "unarmed military personnel."
Despite the pullback reports, activists say violence continues to rage in Syria, where a year-long bloody government crackdown against protesters have left thousands dead.
"We haven't really settled on the final figure" of monitors, "but the numbers I've been reading in the media are 200 to 250," Fawzi said.
The planning team "will talk to a range of people in the Syrian government. They need to talk to all levels of people in the government, the military and security apparatus. They need to talk about logistics of deployment of this force. You don't just send troops in," he said.
Fawzi said the Tuesday deadline is "very clear" and "precise."
Asked whether the planning team would communicate with the Syrian opposition, he said "no."
"There will be a 48-hour cease fire after April 10," he said. "We hope monitoring mission will be in place (to verify the cease-fire on April 10), but it has to be determined by Security Council," he said.
As Annan works to quell the violence, the clashes, shelling and raids have sent scores fleeing into neighboring nations.
Several miles away from the city of Idlib, where the Syrian government claimed to have begun the withdrawal of its forces, eyewitnesses said a military helicopter fired rockets on Thursday against the town of Taftanaz. A video e-mailed to CNN by opposition activists in the neighboring town of Binnish showed a helicopter which appeared to be firing missiles.
Binnish, Taftanaz and other towns in Idlib province have been the target of a recent Syrian military offensive that has triggered a fresh wave of refugees fleeing to neighboring Turkey.
More than 1,600 Syrians have arrived in Turkey in the past day, according to the latter's disaster and emergency management agency, bringing the total number of Syrian citizens in Turkey to more than 21,000 people.
A refugee named Imad Dibo, from the village of Maraa said he was among a group of three families that escaped together to Turkey from Syria's Idlib province because of attacks by security forces. He said some people traveled by car and others, like his group, crossed into Turkey on foot.
The LCC said the regime has initiated a new tactic: "systematically burning and bulldozing homes of revolutionaries and their families in order to displace them from their respective areas.
"On Wednesday, during their destruction and killing campaign, the regime's army deliberately set at least 20 houses on fire," in one Idlib province town," the LCC said on Thursday. "This morning, in the city of Douma, regime forces barbarically destroyed and set many houses on fire. Yesterday in Zabadani and depriving the townspeople of their livelihood, regime forces set many farms and orchards on fire."
The United Nations has estimated at least 9,000 people have been killed in Syria since anti-government protests started in March last year, while opposition activists have come up with higher figures. The opposition Local Coordination Committees, a network of activists on the ground, has documented more than 11,000, deaths.
"We coordinated with smugglers and the Turkish army received us," Dibo said. "The regime is responsible for all of this. They send tanks, armed gangs to kill people."
CNN cannot verify accounts of violence in Syria as the government has severely restricted access to the country by foreign journalists.
