  <text>On Tuesday, Zimmerman's former lawyers 
portrayed him as erratic and in precarious mental condition.
said Zimmerman was OK: 'I'm not concerned about his mental well-being'.
He said his client will plead not guilty at his arraignment, which has not yet been scheduled - and that he will try and secure a bond that's affordable for Zimmerman's family.
O'Mara said: 'He is troubled by everything that has happened. And I can't imaging living in George Zimmerman's shows for the last couple of weeks'.
He added: 'He's a client who has a lot of hatred focused on him right now. I hope the hatred settles down'.
Thousands of protestors have demanded Zimmerman face charges after the February 26 shooting of Trayvon, who was unarmed.

Zimmerman was handcuffed by police officers that night and 
questioned, though police released him after he claimed he killed the 
17-year-old in self-defense after he was attacked in the gated community
in Sanford, Florida.
ABC News reported last month that the chief police investigator wanted to arrested Zimmerman, but the local State Attorney's Office objected, fearing prosecutors couldn't win a conviction.
Monday, Corey announced that she would not empanel a grand jury to 
determine whether Zimmerman should be charged. Instead, she said she 
alone would make the decision.
Speaking with the Associated Press today, Trayvon's mother Sybrina Fulton said: 'I would probably give him an opportunity to apologize.
'I would probably ask him if there were another way that he could have settled the confrontation that he had with Trayvon, other than the way it ended, with Trayvon being shot'.
Her voice trailed off, and tears welled in her eyes.
Fatally shot: Some have said Zimmerman uttered a racial slur before pursuing and killing Trayvon, pictured here in 2009, in a 911 call he made to report a 'suspicious' black male
She remained stoic, and expressed faith that the justice system would work as it should.
Both of his parents watched Corey's announcement on television in a room at the Washington Convention Center.
As soon as Corey uttered the words 'second-degree murder,' Martin and Fulton grasped hands, and their attorney, Benjamin Crump, placed his hands over theirs.
Fulton smiled slightly at the news.
said during a news conference Tuesday that they hadn't heard from Zimmerman since Sunday, and their calls and text messages had not
Uhrig added that the attorneys 'started reaching out in every way that we knew how to get him,' but to no avail.

Zimmerman is currently in hiding, and while Sonner and Uhrig claim they don't know where he is, it's far away from Florida.
Uhrig said: 'You can stop looking in Florida, you can look much further away from that.'
However, his former lawyers added that Zimmerman had 
contacted Corey, the prosecutor, a move they said went against their legal advice.
He also contacted Fox News host Sean Hannity without his attorney's knowledge or approval. The details surrounding that call were not immediately known.
He cannot face first-degree murder, murder with premeditation, because only a grand jury can bring that charge in Florida.
the highest crime he could face is second-degree murder. In Florida, 
second-degree murder is a willful killing with a 'depraved mind' that is
The maximum penalty is life in prison and the minimum is 16 and three-quarters years.
is the killing of another person that is not legally excusable or 
justified. Usually, a reckless accident or a heat-of-the-moment action 
where the killer has a less 'depraved mind'.
Second-degree murder: A willful killing with a 'depraved mind.' However, it lacks the forethought or planning required for first-degree murder.Sentence: Minimum is 16 and three-quarters years; maximum is life imprisonment.
A manslaughter conviction in Florida brings at least 9 and one-quarter years in prison and a maximum of 15 years. 
Zimmerman could walk free -- despite the charges -- if he can convince a
judge or a jury that he acted lawfully, in self-defense.
Under Florida's now-controversial 'Stand Your Ground' law, Zimmerman only has to prove that he had a reasonable belief that he would be killed or severely injured when he shot Trayvon.
In police reports, leaked to the press, Zimmerman told investigators he followed Trayvon February 26 because he didn't recognize the hooded teen as he walked through the gated community where Zimmerman worked as a neighborhood watch volunteer.
Zimmerman called police to report the teen and got out of his truck and walked around the neighborhood on foot.

That's when Trayvon attacked him, he says. He was sucker-punched in the face and knocked to the ground.
Zimmerman told officers he opened fire after Trayvon threatened to kill him and bashed his head several times against the sidewalk.
The case has roiled race relations throughout the country, with many saying Trayvon was targeted because he was black.
Zimmerman, 28, is half-wife and half-Hispanic.
If the case goes to trial, public interest could dwarf the last big Florida court case -- the acquittal of Casey Anthony.
The shooting has been the subject of untold hours of media coverage and every available detail has been analyzed.
