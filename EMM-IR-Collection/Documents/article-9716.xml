  <text>The world's major powers wrangled Friday on how to organize a UN ceasefire observer mission in Syria, holding up a Security Council vote on sending the first 30 monitors.
Russia and the United States, and its allies, submitted rival draft resolutions for a vote by the 15-nation body which is now not expected until Saturday.
The two sides argued over whether Syria should give immediate guarantees of freedom of access to the mission and whether the council should warn President Bashar al-Assad of further measures if he does not keep commitments.
On Thursday, UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan asked for a quick resolution approving observer mission so that the advance party can leave early next week.
The envoy also said the council should call on Assad to carry out all commitments under Annan's six-point peace plan, including withdrawing troops and heavy weapons from Syrian cities. Security forces killed eight civilians during demonstrations on Friday, testing the new ceasefire.
The rival resolutions, both obtained by AFP, authorize the deployment of up to 30 unarmed military observers. The UN eventually wants at least 200 monitors in the country where the UN says well over 9,000 people have been killed in the past 13 months.
The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Morocco and Colombia registered one text for a vote demanding "full, unimpeded, and immediate freedom of movement" for the mission.
It also said Assad must "implement visibly" commitments he made to Annan and would force the council to "consider further measures" if Syria does not carry out the promised actions.
Russia submitted a shorter version of the same text taking out the demand for "unimpeded" access by the observers and the warning of new measures. It also takes out a condemnation of human rights abuses in Syria.
France's UN Ambassador Gerard Araud said the council would negotiate the western text "paragraph by paragraph and I suspect it will be a long afternoon."
A diplomat in the negotiations said Russia, the last major ally of President Assad, was "haggling over every phrase" in the draft text.
Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin said the US-European resolution "requires a lot of work" and criticized the "emotional preferences" in the rival text. He warned the talks could go on into Saturday.
Russia wants a brief resolution to get "some boots on the ground" and then negotiate the mandate for the full mission, said Churkin.
Russia and China have vetoed two previous resolutions on Syria saying they were unbalanced. But they have strongly committed to Annan's six-point peace plan and say they are putting increased pressure on Damascus.
The United States and European powers say however that there must be specific security guarantees and terms set out to the Syrian government before the advance mission leaves.
A Western diplomat in the talks said "this advance team should go with the same mandate as the full observation mission. We cannot accept that they go with weaker rules."
"We cannot have a resolution that does not include a condemnation of human rights abuses in Syria," added the diplomat.
The diplomat said slow progress was being made but added: "No country wants to take the risk of being responsible for the team not being deployed."
