  <text>Shortly after the Kabul blast, a bicycle bomb exploded near the main mosque in northern Mazar-i-Sharif city, killing four, injuring 17 and sparking a fight at a university mosque where Shi&amp;apos;ites and Sunnis were both praying.
"Enemies wanted to target the Muslim precession attending prayer, but because of tight security they failed," the city&amp;apos;s senior police detective, Abdul Raoof Taj, told Reuters.
Four people were injured in the mosque scuffle, which broke out when worshippers began arguing about the blast.
Police later defused a mine, found near the site of the explosion and likely intended to target rescuers and security forces attending to victims of the bomb.
A motorbike bomb also appeared to be aimed at Shi&amp;apos;ite worshippers in southern Kandahar city, the Taliban&amp;apos;s spiritual home and centre of a strong push by NATO-led troops to push the insurgents out of their stronghold.
It exploded prematurely, injuring two policemen and three civilians, but causing no deaths.
"We cannot say for certain who the bomber&amp;apos;s target was, but it was probably the Ashura (ceremonies)," said Kandahar police chief Abdul Raziq.
"We have 100 per cent security. The enemies cannot enter the prayer sites. With such actions they want to show they exist."
The NATO-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan, the United Nations and the U.S. embassy all condemned the attack.
The Shi&amp;apos;ite Muslim festival of Ashura marks the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammad&amp;apos;s grandson, Hussein, in the battle of Karbala in Iraq in the year 680.
Ashura is the biggest event in the Shi&amp;apos;ite Muslim calendar, when large processions are vulnerable to militant attacks, including suicide bombings. Pakistan has deployed tens of thousands of paramilitary soldiers and police during Ashura.
Blood has spilled between Pakistan&amp;apos;s majority Sunni and minority Shi&amp;apos;ite militants for decades.
