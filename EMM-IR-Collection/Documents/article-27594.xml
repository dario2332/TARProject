  <text>Western sanctions on Syria for its deadly crackdown on dissent have cost the country almost $4 billion and caused shortages in fuel products, Oil Minister Sufian Allaw said on Wednesday.
"The oil sector has lost almost $4 billion because of the unjust European and US sanctions, blocking exports and imports of oil and oil derivatives," he told a news conference.
Two weeks ago, the minister said Western sanctions on Syrian oil exports had cost his country nearly $3 billion in lost revenues.
On Wednesday, he acknowledged "new difficulties" in Syria's energy needs, especially for domestic gas.
"The measures taken by the EU and United States are behind this crisis. They want to put pressure on the Syrian people by widening the embargo," the minister said.
But "we will also overcome the new difficulties," he said, pointing out that Syria was now importing 50 percent of its domestic gas and gasoil needs.
Allaw said negotiations were taking place with Moscow to sign a long-term accord for domestic gas and fuel oil imports to Syria.
A Venezuelan vessel loaded with 35,000 tons of fuel oil docked in Syria on Monday and another ship is expected shortly, he said.
The EU has adopted several rounds of sanctions, expected to tighten further, to pressure President Bashar al-Assad's regime to stop its crackdown on a 14-month uprising that has cost thousands of lives.
US economic and financial sanctions have been slapped on Damascus and regime figures, including Assad himself, as well as a ban on Syrian oil imports.
