  <text>United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday that plans were being made to send observers to Syria, starting with the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping general as early as Friday.
"We are working to send an observer team as promptly as possible," Ban told a news conference in Geneva, saying Thursday marked a "critical moment" in the UN's six-point plan for ending the violence in Syria.
Ban said he had spoken with UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan who said he would dispatch Norwegian general Robert Mood and his team "as early as [Friday] as a way of preparing this observer mission."
Speaking about the ceasefire which came into force at 6 am Damascus time, the UN secretary general said: "The situation looks calmer. We are following it closely.
"The world is watching however with skeptical eyes," he added, since previous promises made by the Syrian regime "have not been kept.""Once again I call on the government of Syria to fully implement ... the six-point plan," said Ban.
"I also call on the Syrian opposition to sustain the cessation of violence in all its forms," he added. "This is a time for a fundamental change of course. It's time to stop the killing."
