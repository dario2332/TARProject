  <text>Syrian troops shelled a rebel-held town on Monday, sparking intense clashes that sent bloodied victims flooding into hospitals and clinics, activists said.
The violence in Rastan, in the restive central Homs province, and elsewhere around the country is eroding an internationally brokered peace plan that many observers see as the last hope to calm the 14-month-old crisis.
An amateur video showed a young girl who apparently suffered shrapnel wounds in her thigh undergoing treatment in a makeshift Rastan hospital while screaming in pain. Asked where her mother was, the girl cries: "She died."
New observers joined the existing team of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) on Monday to oversee the peace plan put forward by special envoy Kofi Annan to bring an end to Syria's deadly crisis.
The UN mission in Syria now numbers 250, consisting of 189 military observers and 61 civilians, according to UNSMIS spokesman Hassan Siqlawi. Siqlawi spoke to journalists outside the mission headquarters in Damascus as vehicles left the compound carrying observers to the north of the country.
There are small teams from the UN mission stationed in Homs, Hama, Daraa, Idlib and Aleppo, carrying out their field activities from there. The observers have been deployed in Syria to inspect a shaky truce between the government and armed rebels.
The ceasefire that was supposed to begin on April 12 has had only a limited effect, throwing into doubt the rest of the plan that calls for talks between President Bashar al-Assad's regime and those seeking to end his rule.
Rastan, just north of Homs, has been under rebel control since January. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the activist network called the Local Co-ordination Committees said the latest shelling of Rastan started on Sunday.
Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the rebels were able to destroy several army vehicles during the clashes and kill soldiers. The accounts could not be independently confirmed.
The attack on Rastan came after Syrian forces killed at least five people when they raided a Sunni farming village in Hama province, torching homes and looting shops in what appeared to be a sign of worsening relations among the country's religious groups.
Syria is overwhelmingly Sunni, but Assad and the ruling elite belong to the minatory Alawite sect. Sectarian tensions appear to be growing in some areas, adding a dangerous new element to the violence.
Many Syrians accuse Assad of exploiting that divide by unleashing Alawite gunmen known as "shabiha" who operate as hired muscle for the regime. The government blames the bloodshed on armed gangs and extremists acting out a foreign plot to destabilize Syria.
Tensions stemming from the Syrian uprising also have touched off clashes across the border in Lebanon, in the northern city of Tripoli.
Street battles pitting Lebanese Sunnis — who generally support the Syrian uprising — against Alawite supporters of Assad's regime killed one person Monday, raising the death toll to four since Sunday. The clashes began Sunday after authorities detained an anti-Syrian Lebanese national.
