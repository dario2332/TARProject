  <text>BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese security officials say overnight clashes in Beirut between Sunni groups that support and oppose the regime in Damascus have killed one person and wounded 10.
The clashes in the predominantly Sunni neighborhood of Tariq Jadidah are Beirut's worst in four years. They erupted hours after an anti-Syrian cleric and his bodyguard were shot dead in northern Lebanon.
The officials said Monday that the man who was killed was a member of a pro-Syrian Sunni group. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
Lebanon and Syria share a complex web of political and sectarian ties and rivalries, which are easily enflamed. Last week, clashes sparked by the Syrian crisis killed at least eight people and wounded dozens in the northern city of Tripoli.
