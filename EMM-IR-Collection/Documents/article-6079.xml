  <text>UN general secretary repeats demand President Assad comply with Annan plan as Russia warns against threats and ultimatums
Syria has been urged by the UN to implement "urgently and visibly" an international peace plan by ending all military operations against the opposition by 10 April, but there was little sign on Thursday of any easing of now routine violence.
Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, repeated demands that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, comply with the plan being promoted by Kofi Annan so that a ceasefire can take effect two days later, on 12 April.
"Violence and assaults in civilian areas have not stopped," Ban told the UN general assembly. "The situation on the ground continues to deteriorate."
Syria claimed on Thursday to have began troop withdrawals but there was a sceptical response from the opposition and foreign governments. The Local Co-ordination Committees reported 27 deaths across the country. Army sniper fire and shelling were reported from the Damascus suburb of Douma.
Alain Juppé, France's foreign minister, accused Assad of "deceiving us".
Damascus said it had removed forces from Deraa, Idlib and Zabadani – but an activist in the latter denied the claim.
The Syrian leader again won support from his principal ally, Russia, whose foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned that the Annan plan could not be implemented with threats and ultimatums.
Diplomats call the joint UN-Arab League plan "the only game in town", but both western and Arab governments doubt whether Assad will go along with a scheme that implies the end of his rule. Trust between his regime and a deeply divided opposition is at a nadir after an uprising that has lasted 13 months and seen some 10,000 people killed.
Syria paints the uprising as the product of a western-Arab conspiracy.
Opposition activists are also pondering difficult questions such as whether they would take part in negotiations with the regime, or agree that Assad remain in power even temporarily.
The Annan mission continued with the arrival in Damascus of a senior Norwegian UN officer to look at arrangements for sending in a monitoring mission. But there were signs of familiar haggling ahead for Major General Robert Mood.
The pro-government daily al-Watan quoted an unnamed official as saying that the government was not bound by next Tuesday's deadline for a ceasefire because that day marks "the beginning of army units' withdrawal and not the end".
Similar wrangling took place late last year when Syria said it had accepted an Arab League peace initiative but argued long and hard over the details. The mission ended in failure and withdrawal of the monitors and did not halt the violence.
