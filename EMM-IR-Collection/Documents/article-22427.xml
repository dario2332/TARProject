6pm: Two days before Chicago hosts a summit of NATO leaders, the city's mayor Rahm Emanuel has said the wide-ranging security measures and months of preparations that went into the event are already starting to pay off.
AP reports that Emanuel said in an interview that the president of Latvia had recently joined him to discuss a possible deal in the transportation industry — "an example, he explained, of the kind of partnership that might happen between Chicago and other countries whose leaders are spending the weekend here".
"Do I have a contract signed today? No. Did the conversation about a possibility of that happen? Yes," the former White House chief of staff said in an interview. "Many of those conversations happen around these conferences."
The mayor acknowledged the possibility that "some situations" surrounding the summit could be disruptive, apparently referring to potentially large protests. But, he added, "I wouldn't do this if I didn't think this was a great opportunity for the city."
Emanuel has made it clear that he intends to keep the peace, sometimes in ways that raised concerns among members of the City Council. He pushed, for example, to dramatically increase fines for resisting arrest, explaining that the fines were long overdue to be raised.
He backed down after some aldermen worried that the fines might suggest Chicago was intent on curbing First Amendment expression.
If protesters "do it right, they'll get heard. If they do it wrong, nobody will hear it," Emanuel said. "We are going to do our job to allow them to express themselves but not lose control of the public safety."
Emanuel himself will be the subject of a protest on Saturday morning, when a Chicago based group, the mental health movement, marches on the mayor's house to protest against the closure of mental health facilities in the city.
"At 10am, masses of demonstrators will gather at the Irving Park Brown Line stop, where they will be given hospital gowns with "Healthcare Not Warfare," and, "Clinics Not NATO," written on them," the group's Facebook page reads.
"They will go door to door, asking Rahm's neighbors where they can find mental health care, since they Mayor has closed the clinics that serve our communities.
"At 12pm, the Mental Health Movement and supporters will converge on Horner Park at Irving and California, and will then march on Rahm Emanuel's house at 4228 N Hermitage."
On that note, that's all for today. I'll be back tomorrow, covering the action at Emanuel's house and any other developments. Thanks for reading.
5.54pm: Barack Obama was caught between two competing European visions of how to solve the financial crisis at the G8 summit today, report my colleagues Patrick Wintour and Ewen Macaskill, "when David Cameron rejected outright a French proposal to raise €57bn (£46bn) through a tax on financial transactions".
The eurozone crisis is set to dominate four days of intense diplomacy which began in Washington Friday morning and continued through a meeting of G8 leaders at the presidential retreat Camp David on Friday evening. Discussions will continue there on Saturday and onto a Nato meeting in Chicago.
In talks at the White House, only hours before the Camp David summit, Obama met the new French president François Hollande  for a one-to-one conversation in which he explored the possibility of a new approach to the eurozone crisis based on a pro-growth, stimulus strategy. Obama has been pressing for such a strategy for the last three years and has a potential ally in Hollande.
"Much of our discussion centred on the situation in the eurozone," Obama said. "And President Hollande and I agree that this is an issue of extraordinary importance, not only to the people of Europe, but also to the world economy.
"And we're looking forward to a fruitful discussion later this evening and tomorrow with the other G8 leaders about how we can manage a responsible approach to fiscal consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda."
After meeting Obama, Hollande was scheduled to meet David Cameron in Washington before flying to Camp David.
However on arriving in the US, Cameron said: "On the financial transactions tax I'm very clear, we are not going to get growth in Europe or Britain by introducing a new tax that would actually hit people as well as financial institutions. I don't think it is a sensible measure I will not support it."
5.40pm: So the day's activities here in Chicago draw to a relatively quiet close. With the exception of brief clashes on the Michigan Avenue bridge, the large police presence kept their distance from protesters.
While numbers were high at the National Nurses United demonstration, and hundreds of demonstrators were on the subsequent march through the city, we are yet to see the "up to 10,000" protesters that some have predicted for Sunday. Still, 48 hours is a long time in anti-war protesting...
5.07pm CT: In Chicago, the winding, weaving, police-evading march has finally come to an end. Protesters roamed Chicago's centre for more than two hours in 80-degree heat, eventually tiring themselves out.
Around 100 demonstrators are now sitting in Grant park, basking in the sun and largely reflecting on a job well done. Protesters were happy to have the city pretty much to themselves marching down roads and stopping traffic. Police only intervened only once when protesters clogged up a small bridge in the centre of town.
Police were presumably happy to not have to make arrests: officers on bicycles instead flanked protesters as they marched, and stopped trafficon behalf of the pedestrians.
4.43pm CT: There have been large crowds but little violence in Chicago. In the small communities around Camp David in Maryland, there have been smaller crowds and absolutely no violence. Ryan Devereaux sends a summary of the day from there.
A few dozen activists protesting the G8 are sitting under a large tree in Frederick, Maryland conducting a general assembly as I write this update. Folk singer Ryan Harvey just entertained the crowd with a set social justice-oriented tunes. The vibe is lighthearted and laid back.
While the headline of the local paper, the Frederick News Post, reads "County gears up for G-8 deluge", the town is far from overwhelmed. There have been no arrests, no broken windows and no signs of a mob intent on reeking havoc.
It seems the Obama administration's decision to move the summit to Camp David, may turn out exactly as hoped, with small protests taking place far from the eyes and ears of the world's most powerful leaders.
Tomorrow, however, is another day. Activists here are counting on the weekend to swell their numbers. More demonstrations are planned, including a "block party" here in Frederick and a march through Thurmont, the tiny mountain community just four miles from Camp David.
"At noon we expect our crescendo," said 74 year-old Richard Ochs, an organizer of the actions here. He feels today's demonstrations have been a success. "I wish there would have been more protesters but we couldn't ask for a better reception from the press and the townspeople," Ochs said. "I think we made some inroads in this conservative little town."

4.14pm CT: Here's the AP report of the nurses' protest here in Chicago earlier today. It confirms one arrest.
Thousands of nurses and other protesters gathered Friday at a downtown Chicago plaza for a noisy but largely peaceful demonstration demanding a "Robin Hood" tax on banks' financial transactions, before a smaller but more raucous crowd broke away and began marching through city streets.
The marchers chanted slogans and taunted police, who followed on bicycles and on foot. Police horses blocked some intersections as the breakaway groups wound through the city.
Members of National Nurses United, the nation's largest nurses union, were joined by members of the Occupy movement, unions and veterans. City officials have said the event could draw more than 5,000 because of a performance by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, an activist who has played at many Occupy events. Early crowds did not appear to be that large.
The nurses and their supporters dressed in red shirts and wore green felt Robin Hood caps with red feathers. There were few problems at the rally, though police arrested at least one demonstrator as the gathering broke up.
About a dozen police officers, some wearing riot gear, surrounded the protester, who was dressed entirely in black. Police handcuffed him and walked him away from the rally.

3.31pm CT: As Ryan Deveraux has been reporting for us today, Camp David, the Maryland location of the G8 summit, is heavily guarded and protesters are being kept well away. The Associated Press has filed a profile of the isolated retreat, which has been a hotbed of international diplomacy down the years.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill huddled there with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1943 to pore over plans for the invasion of Normandy.
The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel was forged at Camp David under the guidance of President Jimmy Carter. And it was there, too, that President Bill Clinton unsuccessfully tried to broker a deal between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
President Barack Obama, an infrequent visitor, is putting the presidential hideaway on full display for this weekend's summit of the Group of Eight industrial nations, the largest gathering of foreign leaders ever to assemble there. Arriving Friday, the leaders will stroll the camp's leafy paths and bed down in the 11 residential cabins. Four African leaders will join them for lunch Saturday.
More than 50 heads of state have visited Camp David over the past seven decades. But this weekend's G-8 meeting represents the first time more than two foreign leaders have gathered there.
3.21pm CT: After the nurses' union demonstration at Daley Place ended with a singalong led by Tom Morello, protesters set off south through the city on an impromptu march. Some chanting "This is what democracy looks like", others "Fuck the police", protesters were allowed the freedom of Clark St as they marched.
Hundreds joined the march, which eventually veered east towards Lake Michigan, but police on bicycles had lined up a blockade. That seemed to cow the demonstration somewhat, with protesters now slowly heading north back towards the city centre in baking heat. There are still some 300 people, but there's much less chanting.
There have been one or two arrests.
Cpd tackle and arrest one demonstrator, standing on him. Riot gear om the scene yfrog.com/odp5orzj

2.37pm CT: Here in Maryland, anti-G8 demonstrators held a people's summit at a local library in Fredreck, a short drive down the highway from Thurmon, where I was earlier, writes Ryan Devereaux.
Free food was served as speakers addressed issues ranging from military spending and US international influence to the deployment of unmanned drones at home and abroad.
The summit gave way to a short march. About 80 protesters took to the streets of the sleepy town as wide-eyed residents looked on and held up their smartphones.
Demonstrators chanted "fuck cops, we don't need 'em, all we want is total freedom". As far as the march went on, protesters got what they wanted. There were no attempts by police to interfere with the procession, though nine mounted police officers were stationed in front of police headquarters and later seen trotting through city streets.
The march was not confined to police issues, however.  "Everyone here is 100% against the G8," said Dylan Petrohilos. The reasons were both international and local, he explained.
"The G8 is in the area, it's in our community and we don't like that," Petrohilos said, explaining that many residents of Frederick felt the summit was forced upon the community without consultation. In March the Obama administration abruptly announced the G8 would be held at Camp David, rather than Chicago.
Indeed many residents seemed supportive of Friday's demonstration.  "It's a free country," Richard Bailey said, as the march passed by his rock store, Earthly Elements. "We all have the right to our opinion."
As a small business owner, Bailey said there were parts of the Occupy movement he could relate to, particularly critiques of income inequality and corporate power. "I see both sides of things," Bailey said. "If you don't call attention to something, you don't know there's a problem and that's what they're doing."

2.18pm CT: I've been spending some more time here with the nurses' protest in Daley Place in Chicago. While the crowd is impressive, it may not be good news for protesters as a whole.
Those hoping for the turnout at Sunday's main anti-war to be swelled by hundreds of NNU members may find themselves disappointed. Speaking to crowd members here, I'm yet to find one nurse who will be matching on Sunday – in fact it seems many will no longer be in Illinois, let alone Chicago.
Linda Carter, from Augusta, Georgia, was among the protesters who were here solely for the NNU demonstration. "I'm focussed in the healthcare issues," she said. "Besides, we're flying back home."
Still, she was pleased with numbers at the event. "It's wonderful. I just hope that the politicians really listen to what we're saying – that working, low income Americans can't afford healthcare."
Kim Conway, from California, had been planning to be at this protest for "almost a year". She said: "Nurses take care of everyone else. It's time for the banks to step up and pay their share."
Later, a group of anti-Nato protesters set off on a march from Daley Place:

1.50pm CT: Barack Obama's meeting with French president Francois Hollande at the White House has ended, and Ewen MacAskill reports on hints of a compromise over the tricky issue of Afghanistan. Hollande gave an election pledge that he would have all French troops out of Afghanistan within a year, but there seems to be some wriggle room.
At the White House, Hollande insisted he was standing by his pledge to have all French combat troops out by the end of this year, but left the door open for a compromise. He said he was committed to providing assistance on Afghanistan security, but in a different way, and that this would be discussed at the Nato summit, being held in Chicago on Sunday and Monday.
The White House is sympathetic to Hollande, knowing it would be political suicide for him to renege on his pledge less than a week after being sworn in as president. But Tom Donilon, the White House national security adviser, in a briefing on Thursday, suggested one area for a compromise could be the French taking on a different role, shifting from combat to training.
You can read Ewen's full report here.
12.06pm CT: Back here in Chicago, there are around 2,000 nurses packed into Daley Place, their green-clad heads bobbing in unison to an eclectic mix of feel-good pop songs.
The group marched south from their meeting point to the place, where a stage and, of course, a medical tent have been erected.
Tom Morello is the big draw here, and as 12 approaches – the scheduled time for the beginning of the rally – the nurses are being joined by an influx of younger demonstrators.
All members of the National nurses united union are clad in rakish green Robin Hood-style hats, by the way, a reference to the Robin Hood tax campaign's call for a tax on financial trading which would raise billions.

11.15am CT: The French delegation has arrived at Dulles airport in Virginia for the G8 summit.
At the bottom of the stairs is France's President Francois Hollande, followed by Hollande's partner Valerie Trierweiler, and France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.
Our Washington correspondent, Ewen MacAskill, reports that Hollande is at the White House for his first meeting with Barack Obama since his election. Hollande campaigned on a pro-growth strategy, one which chimes with Obama's desire for European stimulus strategy.
Hollande offers the US a useful ally in Europe, one in favour of a pro-growth, stimulus approach to the eurozone crisis. They are also discussing a compromise on Hollande's election pledge to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan at the end of the year. The US is pushing for these troops to be switched to a training role. At the end of their meeting, the two are to make brief statements to the press but are not scheduled to take questions.  Hollande then heads for lunch with secretary of state Hillary Clinton and then on to a meeting at the British residency with David Cameron.
10.50am CT: In the tiny Maryland community of Thurmont, a small number of protesters have gathered to protest the G8 summit at Camp David, a few miles down the road, Ryan Deveraux writes.
Early this morning, Richard Ochs and Donna Plamondon set up a staging area near a local grocery store where they laid out signs and banners condemning war, foreign military occupations and genetic food modification.
"I'm here for social justice in general," Plamondon said. "We gotta get the money out of politics...put some of that money back in schools."
The demonstrators, mostly middle aged, represent Occupy camps from around the country, including Baltimore, Tuscon and Washington DC. Their numbers are small, presently about a dozen, but more are expected to turn out as the day progresses.
Demonstrations will be held until sundown today and tomorrow, and are expected to include large drone replications as well as the participation of Ethiopian expatriates and an anti-nuclear Buddhist monk.
Police plan to keep protesters at least four miles from the presidential retreat, where leaders from the world's wealthiest nations are meeting with Barack Obama. A no fly zone is in effect over the area and local law enforcement agencies are not taking any chances.
