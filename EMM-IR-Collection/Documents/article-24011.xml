  <text>Residents of Donniyeh in North Lebanon blocked the district’s main road at the town of Kafr Hebbo to protest against the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard on Sunday, the National News Agency reported.
The report, however, did not elaborate any further.
The NNA reported earlier on Sunday that an “armed convoy” carrying Abdel Wahed to the northern Lebanese town of Halba to participate in a rally refused to stop at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Akkar. According to the report, the Lebanese army opened fire when the convoy failed to stop, which led to the death of Abdel Wahed and a bodyguard identified as Mohammad Hussein Merheb, both from the town of Al-Beri.
