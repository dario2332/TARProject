  <text>Fierce clashes have been reported between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters in Douma, near the capital Damascus, and in other parts of the country, amid doubts over the government's declared commitment to an imminent ceasefire deadline.
The continuing violence comes as a UN monitoring team, led by Major General Robert Mood, is expected in Damascus on Thursday to review the government's promise of a troop withdrawal to army bases by April 10.
Major-General Mood is a former chief of staff of the Norwegian armed forces and former head of the UN's Jerusalem-based UNTSO Middle East peacekeeping mission.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday that Syrian troops backed by tanks stormed Douma at dawn amid heavy gunfire and shelling.
The UK-based activist group said clashes between soldiers and rebel forces were reported in various parts of the city, located about 13 kilometres northeast of the capital.
Plumes of smoke could be seen rising near the city's main mosque as troop reinforcements were sent in, the Observatory said.
Violence across the country has left at least 170 people dead so far this week despite a pledge by President Bashar al-Assad to implement a peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
Two young men were killed in Kfar Sousa, a neighbourhood of Damascus, early on Thursday when security forces opened fire on their car, the Observatory said.
Five soldiers were meanwhile killed in two separate attacks in the northern province of Aleppo and in southern Deraa, cradle of the revolt that broke out last year in March against Assad's government.
Clashes were also reported in several towns of Aleppo province.
The US on Wednesday criticised the "intensification" of violence against opponents of the regime given Assad's pledge to implement Annan's six-point peace plan by April 10.
"We've yet to be convinced that they have any intention of complying with the April 10 deadline," US State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters.
The unrest in Syria has left more than 9,000 people dead since mid-March last year, according to UN figures, raising fears that the unrest could spill into outright civil war.
Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said on Wednesday that under-equipped rebels would never be able to defeat Syria's military, and warned of "carnage" for years to come if the violence continued.
"It is clear as day that even if the Syrian opposition is armed to the teeth, it will not be able to defeat the government's army," the Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying while on a visit to the former Soviet nation of Azerbaijan.
"Instead, there will be carnage that lasts many, many years - mutual destruction."
