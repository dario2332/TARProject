Syrian activists have reported military attacks and arrest raids in towns across Syria and deny claims by the foreign minister that regime forces have begun pulling out of some areas in compliance with a UN-brokered truce.
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero dismissed Syria's claims of a withdrawal as "a new expression of this flagrant and unacceptable lie" and British Foreign Secretary William Hague accused Damascus of using the ceasefire deadline "as a cover for intensified military efforts to crush Syria's opposition".
Even close ally Russia seemed critical of President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
"We believe that their efforts to implement the plan could have been more active and resolute," said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Activists said they have seen no signs of the large-scale troop pullback that Assad committed to under the ceasefire brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. Military forces were supposed to withdraw from towns and villages on Tuesday with both sides ceasing all hostilities by 6am local time on Thursday.
The truce is widely seen as the last chance for diplomacy, and its collapse could push Syria even closer to an all-out civil war.
Annan has not commented on the apparent breakdown of his plan, and his spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, would only say Tuesday that it's up to the UN Security Council to decide what to do next.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said there were no indications the Syrian regime was pulling back forces. Instead, the group and activists in Syria reported shelling attacks and raids in several locations in the north, centre and south of the country, it said.
In northern Idlib and central Hama province, troops backed by helicopters were firing heavy machine guns to try to flush out opposition fighters, an activist said.
The Observatory said troops also fired shells at the town of Mareh in northwestern Syria and at two neighbourhoods in the central city of Homs. Additional raids were reported in two southern village, the group said. A resident of the Damascus suburb of Douma, said tanks were patrolling the streets, as they have in recent days.
In Moscow, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem claimed the regime is complying with the truce deal.
"We have already withdrawn forces and army units from several Syrian provinces," he said in a joint news conference with Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.
The regime made new, last-minute demands over the weekend, saying it could not withdraw troops from towns without written guarantees that the rebels would lay down their arms.
Moallem raise another new demand, saying that the ceasefire must start simultaneously with the deployment of the international observer mission. The deployment of observers was one of the terms of Annan's plan.
And in another apparent shift, Moallem said Syria wants the truce guarantees to be issued by Annan, not by the opposition fighters.
The Syrian opposition has said that while it is ready to go along with the Annan plan it would not provide written guarantees.
Unlike previous peace plans, this one has the backing of Assad allies Russia and China because it did not call for the Syrian leader to step aside ahead of talks on a political transition.
Lavrov said blame lay with both the regime and the opposition for the difficulties in implementing the truce, repeating Russia's call for the West to pressure rebel fighters to halt violence.
"The United States and other countries that have stable contacts with various Syrian opposition groups should not blame everything on Russia and China, but use their own influence to force everyone to stop firing on each other," he said.
Lavrov also called for a speedy deployment of international observers - including Russians - in the country. Such a deployment is key to making a truce stick and a small contingent could be dispatched quickly, he said.
The 13-month uprising against Assad's regime has turned increasingly militarised in response to a brutal regime crackdown. The fighting is also spilling across Syria's borders, raising the risk of a regional conflagration. The UN says has claimed more than 9000 lives.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday accused Syria of violating the border and said his country is considering what steps to take in response, including measures "we don't want to think about." He did not elaborate.
Moallem on Tuesday accused Turkey of helping fuel the violence. Turkey "is hosting gunmen, giving them training camps, allowing them to cross the border and smuggle weapons," he said.
"All these acts contradict Kofi Annan's mission."
