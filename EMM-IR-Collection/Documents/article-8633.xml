(CNN) -- A cease-fire deadline passed early Thursday without reports of major attacks in Syria, opposition activists said, raising dim hopes the warring sides will silence their guns and end more than a year of bloodshed.
A peace plan by international envoy Kofi Annan set a 6 a.m. deadline (11 p.m. ET Wednesday) for government forces and opposition fighters to end the yearlong violence that has killed thousands.
In the flashpoint city of Homs, activist Abu Salah reported no explosions or shelling since the deadline passed.
"Interestingly, we have been only hearing the sounds of birds," he said. "However, we have seen the security forces on alert."
Rebel fighters remained in the city to ward off attacks by government forces, activists said.
"The Free Syrian Army members remain in Homs but there have been no clashes," said Saif al-Arab, another activist. "They perceive their role as only to defend civilians in the face of any raids."
Government forces pounded various rebel flashpoints this week as the deadline loomed, sparking global skepticism that the regime will abide by the call to end attacks.
About 10 minutes before the deadline, a tank fired mortar rounds that landed in a residential area in the city of Zabadani in Damascus Countryside province.
"It was as if Assad's forces wanted to send a last message of warning," said Rania, a local activist who did not want to use both names for safety reasons.
Tanks are roaming the streets and checkpoints remain in place, another resident said.
Syria pledged Wednesday to abide by the terms of the United Nations-backed peace plan but said the government maintains the right to respond to opposition attacks.
The regime has reneged on previous promises to stop violence, describing the uprising as terror attacks and targeting mostly rebel-held areas. President Bashar al-Assad has insisted throughout the crisis that armed terrorist groups are responsible for the violence in the country.
A Syrian foreign ministry spokesman pledged the government's commitment to the peace plan but said the opposition will also play a role.
"People should know that I can say optimistically that 40% of the keys to solve the crisis is in our hands as government," said spokesman Jihad Makdissi. "But the other 60% is in the hands of those who are harboring, channeling weapons, instigating in the media against Syria."
Opposition groups say deaths have occurred daily at the hands of al-Assad's forces. The day before the deadline, government forces attacked several cities, killing at least 98 people, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition network across Syria.
CNN cannot independently verify reports of violence and deaths as the government has severely restricted access by international media.
A fighter from the Free Syrian Army, which comprises military defectors, said they will hold their fire, if the regime does. But he said he was cautiously optimistic.
"Al-Assad cannot withdraw tanks from the cities and towns, because if he does, the whole country will come out and protest against him and he won't tolerate that," said the fighter, who did not want to be identified for security reasons.
Opposition activists have called on the international community to arm Syrian rebels, who are outmatched by government forces.
"The solution is to arm the Free Syrian Army with high-quality weapons," Homs resident Saif al-Arab said about the rebel fighting force. "They are still using Kalashnikovs and light rocket-propelled grenades against the regime's military tanks."
During a visit to Iran -- Syria's key regional ally -- to seek support for his peace plan, Annan warned against militarization and said the issue can be resolved through diplomatic channels. He called on regional governments to work with Syrians.
"Any militarization of the Syrian issue will be disastrous," Annan said at a joint news conference Wednesday with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi.
Salehi said Iran supported Annan as long as his mission did not endorse regime change in Damascus, Iran's state-run Press TV reported.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned regional governments not to supply weapons to opposition groups in other countries, alluding to the situation in Syria, the semiofficial FARS news agency reported.
"If you send your money to pay for weapons and supply guns and disturb (the security of) other states, you should know that some day the arrogant powers may do the same to you," he said, according to the news agency.
Syria's anti-government protests erupted in March 2011, followed by a bloody government crackdown. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have died in Syria since the protests began. The Local Coordination Committees puts the death toll at more than 11,000.
