The UN Security Council has met to discuss the killing of at least 116 people in the Syrian town of Houla, a sign of mounting outrage at the massacre that the government and rebels blamed on each other.
Images of bloodied and lifeless young bodies, lain side by side after the onslaught on Friday, triggered shock around the world and underlined the failure of a six-week-old UN ceasefire plan to stop the violence.
Western and Arab states opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad put the blame for the deaths squarely on the government.
Russia, which along with China, has vetoed Security Council resolutions calling for tougher action, said the "tragic" events in Syria deserve condemnation and called for a UN assessment of the violence there.
Russian Deputy UN Ambassador Alexander Pankin told reporters Moscow was sceptical about suggestions that the Syrian government was behind the massacre, saying it appeared most of the victims were killed with knives or shot at point-blank range.
Moscow rejected a British and French proposal for a Security Council statement on the Houla massacre yesterday, demanding a briefing from the head of the UN observer mission, General Robert Mood, first.
Security Council diplomats said today that they hoped to agree on some kind of condemnation of the massacre, though Russia was clearly at odds with the Western powers regarding who was to blame.
In his public comments so far, General Mood called the killings "a very tragical expression" of the situation in Syria, but refrained from apportioning blame.
"For myself, I have had patrols on the ground all the day yesterday afternoon and today we are gathering facts on the ground and then we will draw our own conclusions," General Mood told the BBC in a telephone interview.
Syrian authorities blamed "terrorists" for the massacre, among the worst carnage in the 14-month-old uprising against Assad, which has cost about 10,000 lives.
"Women, children and old men were shot dead. This is not the hallmark of the heroic Syrian army," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdesi told reporters in Damascus.
However UN and Arab League envoy for Syria, Kofi Annan, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon accused the Syrian government of using artillery in populated areas.
"This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian Government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centres and violence in all its forms," they said in a joint statement yesterday.
A video distributed by activists showed an injured woman, who said she had survived the massacre, blaming shabbiha militiamen for the carnage.
The White House said it was horrified by credible reports of brutal attacks on women and children in Houla.
"These acts serve as a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality," a White House spokesman said.
T&amp;aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore described the incident as "a deplorable act and a clear crime against humanity."
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton spoke of a "heinous act perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its own civilian population" in a statement. The head of the European parliament said it could amount to a war crime.
Meanwhile today, at least 30 people were killed when Syrian army tanks shelled residential neighbourhoods in the city of Hama that have been serving as bases for rebel attacks against loyalist forces, opposition activists said.
The reports could not be verified independently as the media are not allowed to operate in Syria.
Although the ceasefire plan negotiated by Annan has failed to stop the violence, the United Nations is nearing full deployment of a 300-strong unarmed observer force meant to monitor a truce.
The plan calls for a truce, withdrawal of troops from cities and dialogue between government and opposition.
Syria calls the revolt a "terrorist" conspiracy run from abroad, a veiled reference to Sunni Muslim Gulf powers that want to see weapons provided to the insurgents.
