  <text>A suspected car bomb blast outside a police station in central Turkey has reportedly killed an officer and wounded 20 other people on Friday.
Local television network, NTV, and the private Dogan news agency said assailants tried to ram the vehicle into the police station in the town of Pinarbasi, in the province of Kayseri, triggering a clash with police guards outside the building, setting off a bomb.
According to the Minister of Interior Idris Naim Sahin, who told Al Jazeera most of the wounded persons were children of the policemen.
Sahin said the security forces were expecting an attack, and he blamed the Kurdish separtist group, the PKK.
NTV said it was not clear if the bomb went off during the cross-fire or was set off by the assailants.
Television footage showed frantic scenes outside the police station, with fire engines and ambulances on site.
The report said at least five of the injured people appeared to be in serious condition.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the separtist PKK group.
The PKK, listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and by much of the international community, took up arms in Kurdish-majority southeastern Turkey in 1984, sparking a conflict that has claimed some 45,000 lives.
