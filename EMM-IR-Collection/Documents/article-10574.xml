  <text>Hun for the attackers: Afghan police gesture near the scene of an attack in Kabul today. Exact details of what happened remain unclear
A police officer said a suicide bomber
had occupied a building near the bases and was shooting toward the 
Kabul Military Training Center there. The officer spoke anonymously 
because he was not an authorized spokesman.
Iraqi officials say attacks across the country including a car bomb in a northern city have left five people dead.
Security official Hallow Najat from Kirkuk said that the explosion near the city's university killed one and wounded 15, one of three attacks Sunday.
Brig. Gen. Sarhat Qadir, who is a security official in the same province, says a roadside bomb hit the car of a leader in the Sahwa anti-al-Qaida Sunni militias, killing his son, in the town of Hawija.
Meanwhile, gunmen blew up a Shiite family's house in the Sunni-dominated Taji area, killing three and wounding two others, police and health officials said on condition of anonymity.
Violence has ebbed in Iraq, but Sunni insurgents still launch attacks to challenge the Shiite-led government.
It is not yet known if the attacks in Iraq are related to those that have hit Kabul today.
At least five people were wounded in the violence across the city, said Kabir Amir, head of Kabul hospitals.
Sediq Sediqi, a spokesman for the 
Interior Ministry, said two suicide attackers have been killed - one who
was firing from a building under construction behind the Kabul Star 
Hotel and one in a building under construction near the parliament.
The coordinated assaults showed a 
sophistication that is reminiscent of the last sustained attack in the 
heavily guarded capital in September 2011.
In that strike, six fighters with 
heavy weapons took over an unfinished high-rise and fired on the U.S. 
Embassy and NATO headquarters about 300 meters (yards) away. They then 
held out against a 20-hour barrage by hundreds of Afghan and foreign 
By the time the fighting ended, 
insurgents had killed 16 Afghans - five police officers and 11 
civilians, more than half of them children. Six or seven rockets hit 
inside the embassy compound, but no embassy or NATO staff members were 
Fighting was also continuing Sunday in the provincial assaults in Jalalabad city, Logar province and Paktia.
'In Jalalabad city, four attackers 
were killed,' the Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediqi said. 'In 
Logar province, the attack is still going on and the area is surrounded 
by police. In Paktia, the area has been surrounded by police, but a gun 
In the city of Pul-e-Alam in Logar 
province, police chief Ghulam Shakhi said militants had entered a 
building that belongs to the education department, which is near a 
building used by the Afghan intelligence service, and a gunbattle was 
In Paktia province, militants were 
shooting sporadically from a building across from a university in the 
city of Gardez, said the deputy provincial police chief Mohammad Zaman. 
He said Afghan security forces have surrounded the building. The deputy 
governor, Abdul Rahman Mangal, said they believe two or three suicide 
bombers are involved in the attack.
In Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar
province, would-be suicide bombers launched separate attacks on the 
military airfield used by NATO and Afghan forces and a smaller NATO base
nearby. Four attackers wearing suicide vests tried to storm the 
entrance to the airfield in a vehicle, but were fought off by NATO 
forces there. Three were killed and one escaped, said Amir Khan Lewal, 
deputy provincial police chief.
At the nearby base, two attackers were
shot dead before they could breach the bases defenses, but there was 
also an explosion inside the base, Lewal said. It was not immediately 
possible to reconcile his figures with those of the Interior Ministry.
NATO said it was aware of reports of 
an explosion in the proximity of a coalition installation near Jalalabad
but could provide no details about the blast.
