  <text>The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned the Syrian government "in the strongest possible terms" for Friday's massacre in Houla. Some 108 people, including dozens of children, were killed in the attack.
The non-binding statement, issued after an emergency meeting on Sunday, said the attacks on the residential area in Houla "involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings."
Agreed by all 15 member nations, including Syrian ally Russia, the statement repeated calls for President Bashar al-Assad to withdraw heavy weapons from Syrian towns.
"The members of the Security Council reiterated that all violence in all its forms by all parties must cease. Those responsible for acts of violence must be held accountable," said the statement, which was read out by Azerbaijan's Deputy UN Ambassador Tofig Musayev after the three-hour meeting in New York.
"Such outrageous use of force against civilian population constitutes a violation of applicable international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government under United Nations Security Council Resolutions."
The statement came after UN officials confirmed that the death toll from Friday's attack had climbed to 108, with 300 others injured. The dead included 49 children.
The head of the team of UN monitors in the country, Norwegian Major General Robert Mood, told the council via a video-link from Damascus that the deaths had been caused by shrapnel and gunfire at point-blank range.
