BEIRUT &amp;mdash; A group of Lebanese  Shiites who were kidnapped in Syria were released in good health Friday,  three days after Syrian rebels abducted the men as they returned from a  religious pilgrimage, officials said.
The hostages were believed to be 11 Lebanese and one Syrian driver.
Lebanese and Syrian officials have blamed Syrian rebels for the kidnappings.
The kidnappings came at a time of deep tension in  Lebanon over Syria. The countries share a complex web of political and  sectarian ties and rivalries, which can quickly turn violent.
Clashes linked to the conflict in Syria have killed at least 10 people in Lebanon the past two weeks.
Crackdowns on protests, as well as  other government and rebel attacks, are routine despite the deployment  of more than 250 U.N. observers who have fanned out around Syria to  monitor a cease-fire brokered by international envoy by Kofi Annan.
The Observatory said one person was killed and another  wounded in Aleppo, a major economic hub which has remained largely  supportive of Assad throughout the uprising but where anti-regime  sentiment has been on the rise in recent weeks.
