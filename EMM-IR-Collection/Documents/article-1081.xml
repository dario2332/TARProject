  <text>Clashes between police and protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square erupted for a third day Monday while the death toll rose to 22, amid fears Egypt's first vote since Hosni Mubarak's ouster could be affected.
Police and military forces sporadically used batons, tear gas and birdshot to try to clear the central square of thousands of protesters demanding that the ruling military cede power to a civilian authority.
By mid-morning Monday large crowds were again streaming to Tahrir, the symbolic heart of demonstrations that toppled Mubarak in February, correspondents said.
The health ministry said 22 people had died in the violence, kicking off a violent countdown to the country's November 28 parliamentary elections, the first since the end of former president Mubarak's 30-year-rule.
"The deaths in [Cairo's] Tahrir Square and several provinces has reached 22," since clashes broke out on Saturday, the Egyptian Health Ministry said in a statement carried by the official MENA news agency.
Hundreds have also been injured during the protests that broke out in Cairo, Alexandria and the canal city of Suez.
The clashes first erupted on Saturday, a day after large crowds staged a peaceful anti-military mass rally at the square, resuming on Sunday and carrying through the night into Monday morning, witnesses and television footage showed.
Police and troops on Sunday seized the square only to be beaten back by protesters who retook it later, as had also happened on Saturday.
Friday's rally, which grouped Islamist and secular activists, called on the military to hand power to a civilian government. It also demanded more control over the constitution the new parliament is to draft.
