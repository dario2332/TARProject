  <text>A UN team sent by international peace broker Kofi Annan arrived in Syria on Thursday to pave the way for observers in the event the UN Security Council approves a monitoring mission.
The advance team headed by Norwegian General Robert Mood, a Middle East specialist, would discuss with the authorities "the modalities of the eventual deployment of the UN supervising mission," Annan spokesperson Ahmad Fawzi said.
Annan had told the Security Council on Monday it should consider whether to send a mission to monitor events in Syria, where activists say more than 10,000 people have been killed since March 2011 in the crackdown on dissent.
Fawzi said the observers can be sent only after a Security Council resolution ordering their deployment.
The council formally backed the April 10 deadline that former UN chief Annan agreed with Damascus to end its military offensive on protest cities.
On Monday, Annan said Assad had agreed to "immediately" start pulling his troops out of protest cities and complete a troop and heavy weapons withdrawal by April 10.
But pro-government daily Al-Watan quoted a government official as saying Damascus is not bound by a deadline.
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the West against issuing ultimatums to Damascus.
