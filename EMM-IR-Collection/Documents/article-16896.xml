  <text>At least 11 people were killed when an aircraft carrying 21 crashed Monday in a remote mountainous area of northern Nepal popular with trekkers, police said.
The Agni Air plane plunged into a hill close to Jomsom near the Annapurna mountain range, police spokesman Binod Singh told Agence France Presse.
"The plane was about to land at Jomsom airport. It hit a muddy slope and the plane is now buried in the side of the hill," he said, adding that six survivors, including two children, had been rescued.
"Seven men and four women have been killed," he added.
He said there had been an unknown number of foreign passengers on board, while the Press Trust of India news agency reported that four Indians were among the dead.
Singh said the aircraft had been carrying 18 passengers and three crew members.
