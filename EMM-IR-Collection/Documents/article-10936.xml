United Nations military observers
arrived in Syria to monitor a cease-fire agreement amid
continued clashes between forces loyal to President Bashar al- Assad and army defectors.
“The advance team of six UN observers arrived in Damascus
last night, under the command of Moroccan Colonel Ahmed
Himmiche,” said Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for UN special envoy
Kofi Annan. They will set up operating headquarters today and
establish contact with the government and opposition forces “so
both sides fully understand” their role, Fawzi said today in an
e-mailed response to questions. A further 25 observers are
expected to follow in the next few days, he said.
The observers are due to monitor a six-point cease-fire
plan to end a conflict that has killed more than 9,000 people
since March last year and increasingly divided the country on
sectarian lines. The government and opposition agreed to
implement the truce starting from April 16, and both sides have
accused the other of violating it.
Assad’s forces engaged in “fierce clashes” at dawn today
with army defectors in the northern province of Idlib while
government forces fired mortar rounds on al-Khaldiyeh and al-
Bayyada neighborhoods in the central city of Homs, the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights said in an e-mailed statement.
The observers are due to draft a report to Annan before a
Security Council resolution, possibly next week, to deploy an
additional 250 monitors, including civilians and human rights
activists, Fawzi told Al Jazeera television. The monitors will
coordinate their mission with the Syrian government and should
be granted free access to travel across the country, he said.
The Syrian government can only be responsible for the
safety of the UN monitors if it is “involved with all steps on
the ground,” Assad’s media advisor Bouthaina Shaaban told
reporters in Damascus yesterday. The Syrian government also
reserves the right to approve the nationalities of the UN
Annan’s peace plan won backing from Russia and China, two
countries that had vetoed earlier efforts by the U.S. and its
European and Arab allies to pass a Security Council resolution
calling for Assad to cede power.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem is due to travel
to China for two days “to discuss bilateral issues and the
mission of Annan,” the official Syrian Arab News Agency
Assad and many of his senior officials are from the Alawite
sect, affiliated to Shiite Islam, while the majority of Syria’s
population and most of the leading opposition groups are Sunni.
