  <text>BEIRUT (AP) — Activists say government troops have killed at least 50 people, including 13 children, in attacks in the central Syria.
The activists say President Bashar Assad's forces opened fire Friday with heavy machine guns, tanks and mortars in Houla, a region that includes several towns and villages in the central province of Homs.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees both say at least 50 people were killed.
The Observatory says the dead included 13 children, and that some 100 people were wounded.
Homs has been among the hardest hit provinces in a government crackdown since an uprising against Assad's regime began in March last year. The U.N. said several weeks ago that 9,000 people have been killed in Syria in the past 15 months.
