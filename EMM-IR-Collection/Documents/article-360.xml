  <text>Gardai are appealing for information on the whereabouts of a man as part of a renewed investigation into the murder of a young woman in South Galway six years ago.
Crimestoppers is launching the new appeal to track down John Griffin of Cardinal Cushing Road in Mervue.
Gardai believe Griffin may have information that could help progress the investigation.
The body of 23-year-old art student, Emer O'Loughlin, was found in the burnt out mobile home she had been living in, in a field between Tubber and Kinvarra on 8 April, 2005.
Tests carried out following an exhumation of her remains in May 2010, revealed she died violently.
