  <text>KABUL, Afghanistan, May 27 (UPI) -- Afghanistan's president said he ordered an investigation into a NATO airstrike that reportedly wiped out a civilian family in Paktia Province.
President Hamid Karzai said Sunday he wanted answers after the air raid killed eight members of a family that local officials said had nothing to do with insurgents.
A coalition spokesman told Voice of America the airstrike had been called in by NATO troops who were battling insurgents in the area.
The raid occurred on the same day four NATO soldiers were killed in bomb attacks in southern Afghanistan, the military alliance announced in Kabul Sunday.
The nationalities of the soldiers weren't disclosed, although NATO said the deaths were a result of three roadside bombings, The New York Times said.
Spokesman Maj. Martyn Crighton said the attacks didn't appear to have been coordinated.
The deaths raised this month's toll to 33 for the international intervention launched to roust Taliban and al-Qaida Muslim extremists that began in 2002.
