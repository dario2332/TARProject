  <text>BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian activists say regime forces fired on a funeral procession in the presence of U.N. observers, causing many casualties.
The activists said the observers were not among the wounded Tuesday, but their vehicles were damaged.
A U.N. spokesman confirmed the observers were caught up in the country's violence on Tuesday and their cars sustained damage. But Ahmad Fawzi, a spokesman for special envoy Kofi Annan, had no other details.
An Idlib-based activist, Fadi al-Yassin, said he witnessed the attack on the funeral and saw that the observers were there.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing a network of sources on the ground, also reported the attack.

ROME (AP) — Syria's opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Council, has re-elected its president Burhan Ghalioun to another three-month term.
Bassam Imadi, the council's representative in Rome, said the vote was taken during a conference of council members here Tuesday.
Ghalioun has said the election showed that the council worked by consensus and is there to "serve the revolution." He called for decisive action to enforce U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan, warning it risked failure.
World powers have backed the Annan plan, but the bloodshed has not stopped.
More than 200 U.N. observers have been deployed in Syria to oversee the truce between the government and armed rebels. The U.N. estimates the conflict has killed more than 9,000 people.
