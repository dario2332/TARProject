  <text>Turkey PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the United Nations Security Council of indirectly supporting the oppression of the Syrian people by failing to unite on Syria.
Mr Erdogan said the Security Council was standing by with its "hands and arms tied" while the Syrian people were dying every day.
Russia says Syria has promised to pull its forces from cities by 10 April.
In Damascus, the head of Red Cross has been meeting top Syrian officials.
Jakob Kellenberger has been trying to get Syria to allow aid workers better access to those who have been wounded or displaced by the conflict.
Mr Kellenberger will also press the Syrian authorities to implement a daily two-hour ceasefire, as stipulated in the peace plan proposed by the UN and Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan.
No date has been set, but Mr Nasser said he had suggested 13 April, after the 10 April deadline for the military pullback and a mutual ceasefire has passed, our correspondent adds.
The statement did not give any further details.
The team would be made up of five to six people, he added.
The announcement comes the day after Mr Annan urged the UN Security Council to set a deadline of 10 April for a ceasefire plan to come into force.
Syria says it has agreed to the deadline.
But activists say government forces have continued to attack opposition strongholds.
Mr Erdogan said by not taking a decision on Syria, the UN Security Council had "indirectly supported the oppression. To stand by with your hands and arms tied while the Syrian people are dying every day is to support the oppression".
He told members of parliament from his governing AK Party that Turkey would not turn its back on the Syrian people.
On Monday, Mr Annan told the UN Security Council that President Assad had agreed to withdraw security forces from major population centres by 10 April, diplomats said.
Mr Annan also asked the Security Council to plan for the deployment of UN observers to supervise the ceasefire by all parties, as set out in his peace plan.
UN officials and diplomats said the monitors would probably be drawn from other peacekeeping forces in the region and could not be established without an end to the fighting, agreement by all parties and a Security Council mandate.
