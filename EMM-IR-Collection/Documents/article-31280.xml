  <text>The area is near a region inhabited by members of Assad's minority Alawite sect that has been acting as a hub for pro-Assad militiamen, activists say.
Opposition activists in Homs said the killing started when Syrian troops and militiamen loyal to Assad, known as shabbiha, stationed at roadblocks that surround Houla, fired heavy machine guns at a demonstration in the area on Friday, killing five people.
Free Syrian Army rebels responded by attacking two roadblocks manned by Assad's loyalists, the activists said.
Houla then came under an intense artillery barrage that killed about 15 villagers. Members of the shabbiha militia then entered Houla from the nearby Alawite villages and killed scores of men, women and children by hacking them or shooting them at close range, the activists said.
