The Syrian uprising (2011–present) is an ongoing internal violent conflict in Syria. It is a part of the wider Arab Spring, a wave of upheaval throughout the Arab World. Public demonstrations across Syria began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba’ath Party rule.
Since spring 2011, the Syrian government deployed the Syrian Army to quell the uprising, and several cities were besieged,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; though the unrest continued. According to witnesses, soldiers, who refused to open fire on civilians, were summarily executed by the Syrian Army.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Syrian government denied reports of defections, and blamed "armed gangs" for causing trouble.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Since early autumn 2011, civilians and army defectors began forming fighting units, which began an insurgency campaign against the Syrian Army. The insurgents unified under the banner of the Free Syrian Army and fought in an increasingly organized fashion; however, the civilian component of the armed opposition lacked an organized leadership.
The uprising has sectarian undertones, though neither faction in the conflict has described sectarianism as playing a major role. The opposition is dominated by Sunni Muslims, whereas the leading government figures are Alawites,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; affiliated with Shia Islam. As a result, the opposition is winning support from the Sunni Muslim states, whereas the government is publicly supported by the Shia dominated Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah.
According to various sources, including the United Nations, up to 11,730–17,000 people have been killed, of which about half were civilians, but also including 5,085–6,350 armed combatants from both sides and up to 1,400 opposition protesters.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Lebanon, and Turkey.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The total official UN numbers of Syrian refugees reached 42,000 at the time,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; while unofficial number stood at as many as 130,000.
UNICEF reported that over 500 children have been killed,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Another 400 children have been reportedly arrested and tortured in Syrian prisons.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Both claims have been contested by the Syrian government.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Additionally, over 600 detainees and political prisoners have died under torture.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Human Rights Watch accused the government and Shabiha of using civilians as human shields when they advanced on opposition held-areas.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Anti-government rebels have been accused of human rights abuses as well, including torture, kidnapping, unlawful detention and execution of civilians, Shabiha and soldiers. HRW also expressed concern at the kidnapping of Iranian nationals.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The UN Commission of Inquiry has also documented abuses of this nature in its February 2012 report, which also includes documentation that indicates rebel forces have been responsible for displacement of civilians.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
The Arab League, US, EU states, GCC states, and other countries have condemned the use of violence against the protesters. China and Russia have avoided condemning the government or applying sanctions, saying that such methods could escalate into foreign intervention. However, military intervention has been ruled out by most countries.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Arab League suspended Syria's membership over the government's response to the crisis,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; but sent an observer mission in December 2011, as part of its proposal for peaceful resolution of the crisis. The latest attempts to resolve the crisis has been made through the appointment of Kofi Annan, as a special envoy to resolve the Syrian crisis in the Middle East.

Syria became an independent republic in 1946. A few years later, democratic rule was overturned by an American supported coup in March 1949.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Two more military coups took place that same year. A popular uprising against military rule in 1954 catalyzed a mutiny that saw the army transfer power to civilians. Free elections resulted in Shukri al-Quwatli, who had been the President at the time of the March 1949 coup, to be elected to that post in 1955. A brief union with Egypt in 1958 resulted in Syria's parliamentary system being replaced by a highly centralized presidential system. The union ended in 1961 with Syria's secession. A 1963 military coup d'état brought the Ba'ath Party to power, and was followed by another coup in 1966.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; In 1970, then Defense Minister Hafez al-Assad seized power and declared himself President, a position he would hold until his death in 2000. Since then, the Ba'ath Party has remained the sole authority in Syria, and Syrian citizens may only approve the President by referendum and do not hold multi-party elections for the legislature.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In 1982, at the height of a six-year Islamist insurgency throughout the country, Assad conducted a scorched earth policy against the town of Hama to quell an uprising by the Sunni Islamist community, including the Muslim Brotherhood and others.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; This became known as the Hama massacre, which left tens of thousands dead.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
The issue of Hafez al-Assad's succession prompted the 1999 Latakia protests,&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; when violent protests and armed clashes erupted following 1998 People's Assembly's Elections. The violent events were an explosion of a long-running feud between Hafez al-Assad and his younger brother Rifaat.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; Two people were killed in fire exchanges between Syrian police and Rifaat's supporters during a police crack-down on Rifaat's port compound in Latakia. According to opposition sources, denied by the government, the protests resulted in hundreds of dead and injured.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Hafez al-Assad died one year later, from pulmonary fibrosis. He was succeeded by his son Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed after a constitutional amendment lowered the age requirement for President from 40 to his age of 34.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Bashar al-Assad, who speaks fluent English and has a British-born wife, initially inspired hopes for reform; a "Damascus Spring" of intense political and social debate took place from July 2000 to August 2001.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The period was characterized by the emergence of numerous political forums or salons where groups of like minded people met in private houses to debate political and social issues. Political activists such as, Riad Seif, Haitham al-Maleh, Kamal al-Labwani, Riyad al-Turk and Aref Dalila were important in mobilizing the movement.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The most famous of the forums were the Riad Seif Forum and the Jamal al-Atassi Forum. The Damascus Spring ended in August 2001 with the arrest and imprisonment of ten leading activists who had called for democratic elections and a campaign of civil disobedience.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Renewed opposition activity occurred in October 2005 when activist Michel Kilo collaborated with other leading opposition figures to launch the Damascus Declaration, which criticized the Syrian government as "authoritarian, totalitarian and cliquish" and called for democratic reform.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Several riots prompted increased tension in Syria's Kurdish areas since 2004. That year, riots broke out against the government in the northeastern city of Qamishli. During a chaotic soccer match, some people raised Kurdish flags, and the match turned into a political conflict. In a brutal reaction by Syrian police and clashes between Kurdish and Arab groups, at least 30 people were killed,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; with some claims indicating a casualty count of about 100 people.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Occasional clashes between Kurdish protesters and security forces have since continued.
The al-Assad family comes from the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam that comprises an estimated 6–12 percent of the Syrian population.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; It has maintained tight control on Syria's security services, generating resentment among some Sunni Muslims&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; , a sect that makes up about three quarters of Syria's population.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; Minority Kurds have also protested and complained.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Bashar al-Assad initially asserted that his state was immune from the kinds of mass protests that took place in Egypt.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Bouthaina Shaaban, a presidential adviser, blamed Sunni clerics and preachers for inciting Sunnis to revolt, such as Qatar-based Yusuf al-Qaradawi in a sermon in Doha on 25 March.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; According to The New York Times, the Syrian government has relied "almost exclusively" on Alawite-dominated units of the security services to fight the uprising. His younger brother Maher al-Assad commands the army's Fourth Armored Division, and his brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat, is the deputy minister of defense.
Socio-economics and human rights
&lt;!--!ignored:main--&gt;
High youth unemployment and economic disenfranchisement of young adults has been prevalent in Syria. A 2007 study by the Dubai School of Government’s Wolfensohn Center for Development, “Youth Exclusion in Syria: Social, Economic, and Institutional Dimensions," examined the aspects of high unemployment rates among young adults ages 15–24 in the country using available jobs data and survey responses. The study found that certain dynamics are particularly acute in Syria, even relative to countries in the region. Though its overall unemployment rate has traditionally been about average for the Middle East (about 25%), what distinguishes Syria is that the youth jobless rate has been more than six times higher than the rate among older adults (only 4%); that constitutes “the highest ratio [youth-adult imbalance] among the region’s countries outside the Gulf States.” The average ratio in the Middle East is 3.3, whereas the world average is 3.5. Additionally, the participation rate of Syrian youth in the labor market relative to adults is “substantially lower than the worldwide average (0.66 compared to 0.79 percent)". Demographic trends have exacerbated the problem; according to the study, "the share of youth in the Syrian population peaked at 25.4 percent in 2005, presenting challenges in terms of job creation for young people; and in 2002, unemployed youth made up 77 percent of the working-age unemployed population in Syria." This is in spite of the burgeoning youth population; the study notes that “labor supply growth rates of around 5 percent per year between 1983 and 2003." Survey responses indicated that most youth were actively seeking employment, but more than “75 percent of unemployed youth had been searching for work for over a year.”&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Socio-economic complaints have been reported, such as a deterioration in the country's standard of living, a reduction of state support for the poor resulting from the gradual transition towards a free market economy, the erosion of subsidies for basic goods and agriculture, free trade without suitable support to the local industry, and high youth unemployment rates.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
The state of human rights in Syria has long been the subject of harsh criticism from global organizations.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The country was under emergency rule from 1963 until 2011, effectively granting security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detention.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Syrian government has justified this by pointing to the fact that the country has been in a continuous state of war with Israel. After taking power in 1970, Hafez al-Assad quickly purged the government of any political adversaries and asserted his control over all aspects of Syrian society. He developed an elaborate cult of personality and violently repressed any opposition, most notoriously in the 1982 Hama Massacre when thousands were killed in order to suppress an Islamic uprising. After his death in 2000 and the succession of his son Bashar al-Assad to the Presidency, it was hoped that the Syrian government would make concessions toward the development of a more liberal society; this period became known as the Damascus Spring. However, al-Assad is widely regarded to have been unsuccessful in implementing democratic change, with a 2010 report from Human Rights Watch stating that he had failed to improve the state of human rights since taking power ten years prior.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; All other political parties have remained banned, thereby making Syria a one-party state without free elections.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Rights of expression, association and assembly are strictly controlled in Syria.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; The authorities harass and imprison human rights activists and other critics of the government, who are oftentimes indefinitely detained and tortured in poor prison conditions.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; While al-Assad permitted radio stations to play Western pop music, websites such as Amazon, Facebook, Wikipedia and YouTube were blocked until 1 January 2011, when all citizens were permitted to sign up for high speed Internet, and those sites were allowed.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; However, a 2007 law requires Internet cafes to record all comments that users post on online chat forums.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In an interview published 31 January 2011, al-Assad declared it was time to reform, that the protests in Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen indicated a "new era" was coming to the Middle East, and that Arab rulers needed to do more to accommodate their peoples' rising political and economic aspirations.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Women and ethnic minorities have faced discrimination in the public sector.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; Thousands of Syrian Kurds were denied citizenship in 1962, and their descendants continued to be labeled as "foreigners" until 2011, when 120,000 out of roughly 200,000 stateless Kurds were granted citizenship on 6 April.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Because the government is dominated by the Alawite sect, it has had to make some gestures toward the majority Sunni sects and other minority populations in order to retain power.

The protest movement in Syria was at first modest, and took a while to gain momentum. The events began on 26 January 2011,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; when Hasan Ali Akleh from Al-Hasakah poured gasoline on himself and set himself on fire, in the same way Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi had in Tunis on 17 December 2010. According to eyewitnesses, the action was "a protest against the Syrian government".&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Two days later, on 28 January 2011, an evening demonstration was held in Ar-Raqqah to protest the killing of two soldiers of Kurdish descent.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 3 February, a "Day of Rage" was called for in Syria from 4 to 5 February on social media websites Facebook and Twitter; however, protests failed to materialize within the country itself.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Hundreds marched in Al-Hasakah, but Syrian security forces dispersed the protest and arrested dozens of demonstrators.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Al Jazeera labeled Syria a "kingdom of silence", concluding that protests would not succeed due to the popularity of al-Assad and concerns over the prospects of insurgency like that seen in neighboring Iraq.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; A protest in late February at the Libyan Embassy in Damascus to demonstrate against the government of Muammar Gaddafi, facing his own major protests in Libya, was met with brutal beatings from Syrian police moving to disperse the demonstration against a friendly regime.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
&lt;!--!ignoredBrackets:File--&gt;
On 6 March, Time magazine suggested that all protests needed to explode into a full-fledged rebellion; this was considered a flashpoint.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Ribal al-Assad said that it was almost time for Syria to be the next domino in the burgeoning Arab Spring.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Indeed, on 15 March, the protest movement began to escalate, as simultaneous demonstrations took place in major cities across Syria.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Increasingly, the city of Daraa became the focal point for the growing uprising. This city has been straining under the influx of internal refugees who were forced to leave their northeastern lands due to a drought which was exacerbated by the government's lack of provision.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Over 100,000 people reportedly marched in Daraa on 25 March, but at least 20 protesters were reportedly killed.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Protests also spread to other Syrian cities, including Homs, Hama, Baniyas, Jassem, Aleppo, Damascus and Latakia. Over 70 protesters in total were reported dead.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Late in the month, the first signs were seen that the government was willing to make concessions to the protesters, when al-Assad announced the release of as many as 200 political prisoners.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; An Assad adviser said the emergency law would be lifted,&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; and Assad accepted the official resignation of the government led by Prime Minister Muhammad Naji al-Otari.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Assad denied the emergency law would be lifted at the end of March, however.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In April, the uprising became more extensive, and more violent. Protesters were shot at on 1 April, leading to at least 10 deaths.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Well over 30 people were killed in a crackdown on protests on 8 April, activists and human rights groups claimed.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Tens of thousands of protesters were prevented from entering Damascus from Douma on 15 April, though this restriction did not prevent widespread protests in many Syrian cities.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Other cities where protesting was particularly strong were in Daraa, Baniyas, Al-Qamishli and Homs.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; There were also protests in Douma and Harasta, suburbs of Damascus. Firing throughout the country resulted 88 deaths among security forces and protesters, making it the bloodiest day so far.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Tanks and soldiers entered Daraa and Douma and the border with Jordan was also closed.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; According to an activist, 18 people were killed in Daraa.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Al Jazeera reported that some soldiers appeared to have been shot by their own comrades-in-arms after refusing orders to fire on protesters.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; On 29 April, more than 60 protesters were killed in demonstrations across Syria. The United States responded with harsh sanctions against the Syrian government.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Protests and military sieges
As protests continued, the Syrian government used tanks and snipers to force people off the streets. Water and electricity were shut off in the city of Daraa, and security forces began confiscating flour and food.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; A similar situation was reported in Homs.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; In May, the Syrian army entered the cities of Baniyas, Hama, Homs, Talkalakh, Latakia, the Al-Midan and Douma districts of Damascus, and several other towns.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
&lt;!--!ignoredBrackets:File--&gt;
Baniyas was besieged in early May, and divided into zones of de facto control, with protesters largely controlling the south and security forces enforcing the laws of the government in the north. Major demonstrations saw nearly 20 deaths on 6 May, and the government said 11 soldiers were shot by "armed groups" on the same day.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The violent suppression of protests in Homs, Daraa, and other rebellious cities continued throughout the month.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; A 17 May report of claims by refugees coming from Telkalakh on the Lebanese border indicated that sectarian attacks may have been occurring. Sunni refugees said that uniformed Alawite Shabiha militiamen were killing Sunnis in the town of Telkalakh. The reporter also stated that according to arms dealers, "sales of black market weapons in Lebanon have skyrocketed in recent weeks driven almost entirely by demand in Syria."&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Early June, the Syrian government said more than 20 Syrian demonstrators were shot dead at the Golan Heights by Israeli forces, when trying to cross the cease-fire line during Naksa Day demonstrations. This was perceived by Israelis as a way for the Syrian government to divert attention from the Syrian unrest by allowing demonstrators to reach all the way to the Golan Heights.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The army also besieged the northern cities of Jisr ash-Shugur&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; and Maarat al-Numaan near the Turkish border.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Syrian Army claimed the towns were the site of mass graves of Syrian security personnel killed during the uprising and justified the attacks as operations to rid the region of "armed gangs",&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; though local residents claimed the dead Syrian troops and officers were executed for refusing to fire on protesters.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The siege of Daraa continued in the meantime, with a French journalist reporting famine-like conditions in the town.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; On 20 June, in a speech lasting nearly an hour, in response to the demands of protesters and foreign pressure, Assad promised a "national dialogue" involving movement toward reform, new parliamentary elections, and greater freedoms. He also urged refugees to return home from Turkey, while assuring them amnesty and blaming all unrest on a small number of "saboteurs". The speech received mixed reactions domestically and abroad and was largely dismissed by protesters.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; On 30 June, large protests erupted against the Assad government in Aleppo (Syria's second largest city) which were labeled the "Aleppo volcano".&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
&lt;!--!ignoredBrackets:File--&gt;
In mid-July, pro-government protesters attacked the US and French embassies in Damascus, responding to those countries' support for the opposition.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned both the attacks and the incumbent government, stating that al-Assad had "lost legitimacy," and that "President Assad is not indispensable and we have absolutely nothing invested in him remaining in power."&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Attacks on protests continued throughout July, with government forces repeatedly firing at protester and employing tanks against demonstrations, as well as conducting arrests. On 31 July, a siege of Hama escalated during a so-called "Ramadan Massacre", in which at least 136 people were killed and hundreds wounded when Syrian forces attacked demonstrators across the country, employing tanks, artillery and snipers. Most of the deaths occurred in Hama.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Syrian forces continued to bombard Hama in early August, along with attacks in other cities and towns.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; On the first full weekend of Ramadan, the Arab League and several Gulf Cooperation Council member states led by Saudi Arabia broke their silence on the events in Syria to condemn the government's response.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Throughout August, Syrian forces stormed major urban centers and outlying regions, and continued to attack protests.
On 14 August, the Syrian Navy became involved in the military crackdown. Gunboats fired heavy machine guns at waterfront districts in Latakia as ground troops and security agents backed by armor stormed several neighborhoods. Up to 28 people were killed. Eight more civilians were killed elsewhere in the country.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Throughout the next few days, the Siege of Latakia dragged on, with government forces and shabiha militia continuing to fire on civilians in the city, as well as throughout the country over the following days. On 30 August, during the first day of Eid ul-Fitr, thousands of people demonstrated in Homs, Daraa, and suburbs of Damascus. Nine people were killed when security forces fired on these demonstrations. Eid celebrations in the country were reportedly muted, with people trying to visit the graves of their loved ones being killed.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Protests continued into the following months, with security forces and militia continuing to fire at demonstrators and raid towns and neighborhoods across the country.
On 7 October, prominent Kurdish rights activist Mishaal al-Tammo was assassinated when masked gunmen burst into his flat, with the Syrian government blamed for his death. At least 20 other civilians were also killed during crackdowns on demonstrations across the country. The next day, more than 50,000 mourners marched in Al-Qamishli to mark Tammo's funeral, and at least 14 were killed when security forces fired on them.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In August, The Jerusalem Post reported that protesters enraged at Hezbollah's support for Assad's government burned Hezbollah flags and images of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in several places in Syria.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Pro-government protestors have carried posters of Hassan Nasrallah.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Hezbollah states they support a process of reforms in Syria and that they also are against what they term US plots to destabilize and interfere in Syria.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Six months into the uprising, the inhabitants of Syria's two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, remain largely uninvolved in the anti-government protests.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The two cities central squares have seen rallies in the tens of thousands in support of Assad and his government.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Analysts and even opposition activists themselves acknowledge that without mass participation in the protest movement from these two cities, the government will survive and avoid the fate of its counterparts in Egypt and Tunisia.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;
Throughout August and September, Syrian forces continued to suppress protests, with hundreds of killings and arrests reportedly having taken place. The crackdown continued into the first three days of November. On 3 November, the government accepted an Arab League plan that aims to restore the peace in the country. According to members of the opposition, however, government forces continued their suppression of protests. Throughout the month, there were numerous reports of civilians taken from their homes turning up dead and mutilated, clashes between loyalist troops and defectors, and electric shocks and hot iron rods being used to torture detainees.
Protests and armed clashes
&lt;!--!ignoredBrackets:File--&gt;
On 14 November, more than 70 people were killed across Syria as the army clashed with defectors and shot at civilians. Some 34 soldiers and 12 defectors were killed, along with 27 civilians.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 9 November, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the country could slip into "a Libyan-style civil war".&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 12 December, local elections under reformed electoral law were held amid the tensions.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Activists said security forces killed up to 70 army defectors on 19 December as they were deserting their military posts near the Turkish border. At least 30 other people died in other violence across the country, the activists said. If accurate, it would be one of the heaviest daily tolls of the entire revolt up until December.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 23 December, two suicide bombs hit two security facilities in Damascus, killing 30 civilians and soldiers. The government stated the attack "carried the blue print of al-Qaeda", whereas opposition members blamed the government,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; and hinted that the government itself may have been behind the attacks to make its case to Arab League observers who arrived in the country only the day before. Government officials brought the advance team of Arab League observers to the scene to see the wreckage. Omar Idilbi, a member of the Syrian National Council thought the explosions "very mysterious because they happened in heavily guarded areas that are difficult to be penetrated by a car."&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Two days earlier, Lebanese authorities had warned that al-Qaeda members were entering Syria from North Lebanon.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 6 January 2012, a suicide bomb attack in the central Damascus neighbourhood of al-Midan killed 26 people, most of which civilians.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Syrian government blamed the attack on terrorists and vowed to respond with an "iron fist" to security threats. Responsibility for the attack was later claimed by the Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
&lt;!--!ignoredBrackets:File--&gt;
On 11 January, a mortar attack on a pro-government rally in Homs killed a French journalist, Gilles Jacquier of France 2, and seven others.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 27 January, Arab League observer mission reported on attacks carried out by opposition forces.
Recently, there have been incidents that could widen the gap and increase bitterness between the parties. These incidents can have grave consequences and lead to the loss of life and property. Such incidents include the bombing of buildings, trains carrying fuel, vehicles carrying diesel oil and explosions targeting the police, members of the media and fuel pipelines. Some of those attacks have been carried out by the Free Syrian Army and some by other armed opposition groups.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
On 1 February, Riad al-Asaad, commander of the Free Syrian army, claimed that “Fifty percent of Syrian territory is no longer under the control of the regime,” and that half of the country was now effectively a no-go zone for the security forces. He said the morale of government troops was extremely low. “That’s why they are bombing indiscriminately, killing men, women and children,” he said.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Protests have drifted abroad to the doorsteps of Syrian embassies. After the opposition had claimed that more than 200 people perished in the massacre in Homs on 2 February 2012, both Syrian and non-Syrian protesters in Cairo, Kuwait City, and London damaged their respective Syrian embassy.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In an attack on buildings used by Syrian military intelligence in Aleppo, at least 28 people died and 235 were injured on 10 February 2012. The Free Syrian Army, through colonel Arif Hamood, claimed responsibility for the attacks in an interview with France 24, saying mortars and RPGs had been used instead of car bombs as was initially reported.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; However, shortly thereafter another FSA leader, Riad al-Asaad, denied FSA involvement and asserted a false-flag conspiracy in which the Assad government is presented as the perpetrator of the attack on its own buildings.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; A correspondent for the Dutch public broadcaster NOS described the latter as an unlikely explanation for the attacks, pointing out that the FSA have earlier indicated that one of their targets is military intelligence, which they hold responsible for a major part of the violence against the opposition.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;

Since 12 April, both sides, the Syrian Government and rebels of the FSA entered a UN mediated ceasefire period. Despite the intitial plans to begin the ceasefire on 10 April, the Syrian Army continued to pound rebel strongholds for two more days, in an attempt to gain ground, and announced full armistice on 12 April. On 15 April, there were reports of artillery fire on Homs, and several dozens of casualties accumulated across Syria due to infractions of the ceasefire by both sides, despite the promise for pause in hostilities.

On 1 May, Hervé Ladsous, the United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, said that both sides had violated the April 12 ceasefire agreeement.

The Syrian opposition met several times in conferences held mostly in Turkey and formed a National Council.
The Federation of Tenseekiet Syrian Revolution helped in the formation of a Transitional National Assembly on 23 August in Istanbul "to serve as a the political stage of the Revolution of the Syrian people". The Syrian National Council gained the recognition of a few countries, including "sole legitimate interlocutor" by the United States.
Local coordination committees
&lt;!--!ignored:main--&gt;
The networks of anti-government protest organizers formed decentralized "Local Coordination Committees" which drew together the young, unorganized protesters. The Committees are used to document protests and spread anti-government messages throughout Syria. Though they have only a few hundred members, the Local Coordination Committees rose to prominence as the core of the protest movement on the ground, separate from the organized political opposition. The Committees are also noted for trying to reach out to minority groups and diversify the demonstrations.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Armed opposition to the government
Some elements among the opposition are armed, and the Syrian government claims these represent Salafists.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; More than 3,000 members of the Syrian security forces have been killed, which the Syrian government states is due to "armed gangs" being among the protesters, yet the opposition blames the deaths on the government.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Syrians have been crossing the border to Lebanon to buy weapons on the black market since the beginning of the protests.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Clan leaders in Syria claim that the armed uprising is of a tribal, revenge-based nature, not Islamist.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; On 6 June, the government said more than 120 security personnel were killed by "armed gangs" 20 in an ambush, and 82 in an attack on a security post.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The main centers of unrest – Daraa near Jordan, where the uprising began, Talkalakh, Homs, Talbiseh, and Al-Rastan near Lebanon, and Jisr ash-Shugur near Turkey – have been described as being predominately Sunni Muslim towns and cities close to the country's borders where smuggling has been common for generations, and thus have more access to smuggled weapons.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In September, the Syrian government claimed to have killed a total of 700 insurgents.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;

In late July 2011, a web video featuring a group of uniformed men claiming to be defected Syrian Army officers proclaimed the formation of a Free Syrian Army (FSA). In the video, the men called upon Syrian soldiers and officers to defect to their ranks, and said the purpose of the Free Syrian Army was to defend protesters from violence by the state.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; Many Syrian soldiers subsequently deserted to join the FSA.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The actual number of soldiers who defected to the FSA is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 1,000 to over 25,000 as of December 2011.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Nir Rosen, who spent time with the FSA in Syria, claims the majority of its members are civilians rather than defectors, who had taken up arms long before the formation of the FSA was announced. He also stated they have no central leadership.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
As deserting soldiers abandoned their armored vehicles and brought only light weaponry and munitions, FSA adopted guerilla-style tactics against security forces inside cities. Its primary target has been the shabiha militias. Most FSA attacks focused on buses bringing in security reinforcements, which were often attacked either with bombs or through hit-and-run attacks. To encourage defection, the FSA began attacking army patrols, shooting the commanders and trying to convince the soldiers to switch sides. FSA units have also acted as defense forces by guarding neighborhoods rife with opposition, guarding streets while protests take place, and attacking shabiha members. However, the FSA engaged in street battles with security forces in Deir ez-Zor, Al-Rastan, and Al-Bukamal. Fighting in these cities raged for days, with no clear victor. In Hama, Homs, Al-Rastan, Deir ez-Zor, and Daraa, the Syrian military used airstrikes against them, leading to calls from the FSA for the imposition of a no-fly zone.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Free Syrian Army numbers about 15,000 men according to a statement its leader Riad al-Asaad made on Al Jazeera, and he added that these were almost exclusively reserve troops that defected from the Syrian army, and thus were no match against the government's highly trained active-duty troops.
On 15 November, the FSA attacked an air force intelligence complex in the Damascus suburb of Harasta with shoulder-fired missiles and heavy machine guns. A gunfight ensued, and helicopters were deployed to the area.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;

Kurds have participated in the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising in smaller numbers than their Syrian Arab counterparts. This has been explained as being due to the Turkish endorsement of the opposition, and Kurd underrepresentation in the Syrian National Council.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; "The regime tried to neutralize Kurds," said Hassan Saleh, leader of the Kurdish Yekiti Party. "In the Kurdish areas, people are not being repressed like the Arab areas. But activists are being arrested."&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; According to Ariel Zirulnick of the Christian Science Monitor, the Assad government "has successfully convinced many of Syria’s Kurds and Christians that without the iron grip of a leader sympathetic to the threats posed to minorities, they might meet the same fate" as minorities in Lebanon and Iraq.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
In 2012, several cities with large Kurdish populations, such as Qamishli and Al-Hasakah, began witnessing protests of several thousand people against the Syrian government, which responded with tanks and fired upon the protesters.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
Senior Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Cemil Bayik stated that if Turkey were to intervene against Assad, the PKK would fight on the Syrian side. The PKK's Syrian branch is alleged to be involved in the targeting of Kurds participating in the uprising.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
By 10 March 2012, 40 of the 10,553 casualties reported during the Syrian uprising had occurred in the primarily Kurdish Al-Hasakah Governorate,&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt; although the Governorate is only home to approximately 6.7% of Syria's population.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;

According to a Syrian citizen, shabiha is a term that was used to refer to gangs involved in smuggling during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon: "They used to travel in ghost cars without plates; that’s how they got the name Shabbiha. They would smuggle cars from Lebanon to Syria. The police turned a blind eye, and in return Shabbiha would act as a shadow militia in case of need".&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Witnesses and refugees from the northwestern region say that the shabeeha have reemerged during the uprising, and in June were being used by the Syrian government to carry out "a scorched earthed campaign [...] burning crops, ransacking houses and shooting randomly".&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; In April, Wissam Tarif, director of the human rights group Insan, said the shabiha were operating in Homs, and an anonymous witness said they were to blame for some of the 21 deaths there over the course of two days.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;

At the uprising's outset, some protesters reportedly chanted "Christians to Beirut; Alawites to the coffin".&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; However, there have been no videos that confirm such chants, and the opposition accused the government of agitating sectarianism.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Time Magazine reported that, according a former Homs resident who says he came to Lebanon to convince Alawites to turn against the government, government workers were offered extracurricular stipends of up to $500 per month to fan sectarian fears through a graffiti campaign. “The Christians to Beirut, the Alawites to the grave” was a common graffiti smear. He furthermore claimed that other government workers were told to shout sectarian slogans at anti-government rallies.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; One commander from the Free Syrian Army indicated that this is a religious Islamic struggle against a secular government. He claimed that: "For the first time, we are able to proclaim the word of God throughout this land." Although he also stated that they were fighting for all of Syria's religions and sects: Christian, Muslim, Alawite, Sunni, Druze, Shia.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Alawites who have taken refugee in Lebanon have told journalists that they were offered money by the Syrian government to spread sectarianism through chants and graffiti.&lt;!--!ignored simplehtml tags--&gt;
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the primarily Sunni protesters "have a lot of work to do internally" in order to gain the broad public support needed to form a genuinely national movement, and "it is not yet accepted by many groups within Syria that their life will be better without Assad than with Assad. There are a lot of minority groups that are very concerned."&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The opposition does include some prominent Alawites and Christians.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; and the neoconservative US-based Stonegate Institute claimed in early 2012 that Syrian Christians have been persecuted by the government during the uprising and threatened into declaring their support for Assad.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
There have been unconfirmed reports that the Christians of Homs were expelled from their houses by a brigade of the Free Syrian Army.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Local sources told Agenzia Fides that Islamist opposition groups committed massacres against the Christians and Alawites of Qusayr.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; The Jesuit community living in Homs have denied these claims, saying that Christians left on their own accord to escape the uprising's natural violence.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; However, they later reported helping evacuate Christians forcibly expelled from Homs to Damascus.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;
The Syrian conflict has been interpreted as part of a proxy war between Sunni states such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, who support the Sunni-led opposition, and Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah in Lebanon, who support the Alawite-led government in Syria.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Israeli reactions have been mixed, with some believing regime change in Syria would weaken their enemy Iran,&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; and others believing a post-Assad Syria might be more dangerous for the Jewish State.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt; Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy has suggested that Israel should exploit the Shia-Sunni conflict.&lt;!--!ignored html tags--&gt;

The refugee problem began unfolding across Syrian borders on April 2011, intensifying with the siege of Talkalakh and the unrest in the Syrian province of Idlib. As a result, thousands of Syrian citizens fled across the border to Lebanon and Syria by summer 2011. In early 2012, the numbers of Syrian refugees swelled to some 20,000 registered by UN in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
Following the increased fighting in Homs and the escalating assault of Syrian troops on towns and villages near Lebanese border, a large-scale refugee influx into Lebanon was reported on 4 March 2012.
