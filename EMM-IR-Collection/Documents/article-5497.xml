  <text>Washington on Wednesday criticized the “intensification” of violence against opponents of the regime given Assad’s pledge to implement by April 10 Annan’s six-point peace plan. 
Activists reached by phone Wednesday in north, south and central Syria said they had seen no sign that the military was pulling out. Some reported the opposite.
The unrest in Syria has so far left more than 9,000 people dead since mid-March last year, according to U.N. figures.
The revolt against the regime began as a popular uprising but has transformed into an insurgency many fear will lead to a full-blown civil war.
The Syrian National Council, the main opposition bloc, accused the regime of carrying out “a policy of genocide against the Syrian people” and called for immediate pressure from the international community for a pullback of tanks. 
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday predicted that under-equipped rebel forces would never be able to defeat Syria’s powerful military.
“It is clear as day that even if the Syrian opposition is armed to the teeth, it will not be able to defeat the government’s army,” the Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying while on a visit to the ex-Soviet nation of Azerbaijan.
“Instead, there will be carnage that lasts many, many years -- mutual destruction.”
Lavrov said two groups of Syrian opposition representatives would visit Moscow in the coming days and that Russia would try to convince them that it wanted to help resolve the year-long crisis.
Seeking to assuage humanitarian concerns, Syria’s Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem pledged Damascus would do its utmost to ensure the success of a Red Cross mission, at a meeting on Tuesday with visiting ICRC chief Jakob Kellenberger.
Kellenberger, who is pushing for a daily ceasefire, travelled on Wednesday to Deraa to assess the humanitarian needs there, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
Two lorries filled with food aid and hygiene kits, as well as 500 blankets, were unloaded at Red Cross depots in Deraa ready for distribution, ICRC spokesman in Damascus Saleh Dabbakeh told AFP.
The state news agency SANA, meanwhile, said “armed terrorist groups” had burnt down a Syrian Red Crescent depot in the Karabis district of Homs, in an incident condemned by the local relief organization.
