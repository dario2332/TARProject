  <text>Early on Monday gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Turkish buses carrying pilgrims inside Syria, Turkish media reported.
Reports of the incident were fragmentary and Turkish authorities said they were still trying to establish what had happened. Some of the travellers said the attackers appeared to be Syrian soldiers
Alongside the mainly peaceful street protests against Assad, army deserters have launched a series of attacks against forces loyal to the president.
Within hours of Assad ignoring Saturday&amp;apos;s Arab League deadline, residents said two rocket-propelled grenades hit a major ruling party building in Damascus, the first such reported attack by insurgents inside the capital.
A statement by the Syrian Free Army, comprising army defectors and based in neighbouring Turkey, initially said it carried out the attack but the group later withdrew its claim.
In an interview with the British Sunday Times newspaper, Assad said he had no choice but to pursue the crackdown on unrest because his foes were armed.
"The conflict will continue and the pressure to subjugate Syria will continue. Syria will not bow down," he said.
A senior official of the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday it was seeking wider access to detainees held in Syria&amp;apos;s teeming prisons, but negotiations with Syrian authorities are proving difficult.
Syria opened its prisons for the first time ever in early September, promising to allow access to all facilities under the interior ministry. But the visits stalled after a first visit to Damascus central prison at the time.
"So far we have not been able to access other places of detention. We are absolutely negotiating with Syrian authorities and are still hoping to be able to have access," ICRC director-general Yves Daccord told a news briefing.
Hague said his meeting with the opposition did not mean Britain was about to offer them formal recognition, "partly because there are differing groups".
"There isn&amp;apos;t a single national council as there was in Libya ... and the international community has not yet reached that point," he said.
At the talks he met representatives from the National Council and the National Coordination Body, which has been more explicit in its opposition to military intervention in Syria.
"We discussed the situation in Syria and the possibility of international protection to ... stop the bloodshed and provide protection for civilians," SNC chairman Burhan Ghalioun said.
