  <text>Russia's foreign minister urged Syrian peace envoy Kofi Annan on Thursday to also put pressure on the rebels after the UN Security Council called on the regime to keep a deadline on troop withdrawals.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Sergei Lavrov told Annan by telephone that Moscow backed the Security Council statement with the understanding that a second deadline for the armed opposition to lay down weapons would also be imposed.
"The minister stressed that not only the Syrian authorities, but also the opposition must take concrete steps" toward peace, it said in a statement.
The 15-member Security Council on Thursday called on the Syrian regime to implement "urgently and visibly" its commitments to Annan to withdraw troops and forces from major cities by April 10.
If this is carried out Annan will then give the government and opposition groups 48 hours to end all hostilities
