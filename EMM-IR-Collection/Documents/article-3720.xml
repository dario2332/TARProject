HEAVY machine gun fire and artillery have again pounded the central Syrian city of Homs, killing more than two dozen people, activists say, as Syria's government defies ceasefire demands.
Activists said several districts  were hit in the battered city on Sunday, despite world demands on the Syrian regime to end violence that has killed thousands of people in the past year.
In the latest steps, the Friends of the Syrian People meeting in Istanbul was told that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries were creating a $US100 million fund to pay members of the rebel Free Syrian Army and soldiers who defect from the regime.
The money is the first formal international support for the rebels, and officials  at the meeting said the  funds might also be used to buy weapons on the black market for the rebel Free Syria Army. One delegate described the fund as a ''pot of gold'' to undermine  the regime's army.
US Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton said the US was providing communications equipment to help opposition members in Syria organise, remain in contact with the outside world and evade regime attacks.
The moves reflected a growing consensus, at least among the officials who met in Istanbul,  that mediation efforts by  United Nations peace envoy Kofi Annan were failing to halt the violence in Syria and that more forceful action was needed.
With Russia and China blocking measures that could open the way for UN military action, the countries lined up against the government of President Bashar al-Assad have sought to bolster Syria's beleaguered opposition through means that seemed to stretch the definition of humanitarian assistance and blur the line between lethal and non-lethal support.
No agreement has been reached on arming the rebels, as countries like Saudi Arabia and some members of the US Congress have called for, largely because of the uncertainty regarding who exactly would receive the arms.
Still, the offer to provide salaries and communications equipment to rebel fighters with the hope that the money might encourage government soldiers to defect, officials said, was bringing the  Friends of Syria  to the edge of a proxy war against Assad's government and its international supporters, mainly Iran and Russia.
Direct assistance to the rebel fighters, even as Assad's loyalists press on with a brutal crackdown, risked worsening a conflict that had already led to about 9000 deaths and could plunge Syria into a protracted civil war.
Some said that enabling the uprising to succeed was now the best bet to end the instability and carnage sooner.
''We would like to see a stronger Free Syrian Army,'' Burhan Ghalioun, the leader of the Syrian National Council, a loose affiliation of exiled opposition leaders, told the meeting in Istanbul. ''All these responsibilities should be borne by the international community.''
Mr Annan is pushing to end the violence with a six-point plan that calls on the government to pull its forces out of cities and towns immediately and abide by a two-hour halt in fighting every day to allow humanitarian access and medical evacuations, while arranging a permanent ceasefire.
Syria has said it agrees to the plan but has rejected what it actually requires Damascus to do.
Leaders of Syria's scattered opposition have also rejected dialogue with the Assad regime, accusing it of stalling for time and saying it has killed too many people to be considered serious about peace.
