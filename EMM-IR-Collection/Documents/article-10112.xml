  <text>The European Union welcomed on Saturday a UN Security Council vote authorizing an observer force to Syria and urged the regime to cooperate with the mission.
"The resolution presents an unequivocal call from the international community to the Syrian regime to stop violence against its population and to address urgent humanitarian needs," said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
"I call on the Syrian government to take this opportunity to change course, and fully cooperate with the initial observation team," she said in a statement.
"The first priority is to ensure a complete cessation of violence in Syria and to allow for full and unhindered access to humanitarian aid."
The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously agreed to send an advance party of 30 unarmed military monitors to Syria where new violence threatened a fragile ceasefire.
Asthon said the resolution was "an additional step in the right direction in the implementation" of the peace plan put forward by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
"It is also a long-awaited development for the Syrian people after more than a year of suffering from violence and repression," she said.
"Even if the situation on the ground remains very unstable and uncertain, I hope this resolution will open the way to a fully-fledged UN observation mission in Syria in accordance with Kofi Annan's plan."
A new UN resolution will be required to give a mandate to the full monitoring mission of more than 200 observers.
