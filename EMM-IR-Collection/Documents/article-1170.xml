  <text>Thirty-five people have reportedly been killed in clashes between police and protesters in Egypt as calls intensify for military rulers to quickly transfer power to a civilian government.
AP news agency reported the increased death toll, while the country's Health Ministry said another 1,750 people had been wounded.
It was not specified whether the dead and injured were protesters, or whether they included policemen and army soldiers.
Power is due to be transferred by military leaders in 2012 or early 2013, but protesters are demanding a firm date.
As demonstrations grow, more people are calling for the military to step down immediately in favour of an interim civilian council.
Protesters reportedly thwarted an attempt by police to evict them from Cairo's central Tahrir Square on Monday morning after officers fired tear gas and attacked a makeshift field hospital.
Witnesses also said protesters broke up pavements and hurled chunks of concrete at police.
"There is clearly no going back as you can see this violence cannot be swept under the table," said one demonstrator, Essam Gouda, who added that another two marches on Monday were due to converge on the square.
"We aim to control the entry points to the square so that security doesn't block protesters from entering."
Meanwhile, a six-storey apartment building by the square caught fire as the protest continued.
Firefighters arrived but police fired tear gas from a side street at a crowd gathered below, angering bystanders.
The clashes between government forces and protesters in Cairo and other Egyptian cities are the worst since the overthrow of president Hosni Mubarak in February.
