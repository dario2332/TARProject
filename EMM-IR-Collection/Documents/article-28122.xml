The rights group called for the signing of a strong treaty on  the global arms trade when the United Nations meets on the issue in  July, saying it would be an acid test for world leaders to place  rights over profits.
Amnesty highlighted the failure to end the bloodshed in Syria  and said repeated vetoes by major arms exporters Russia and China  had left the UN's top security body "looking redundant as a  guardian of global peace".
The report also singled out emerging powers India, Brazil and  South Africa, saying they were "complicit through their silence" on  key rights issues.
"You've had people standing up, putting their lives on the  line," Amnesty's Secretary General Salil Shetty told AFP.
"Unfortunately that has been met by a complete failed leadership  both at the national and global level."
Shetty said in the 21st century the UN Security Council was  "simply not fit for purpose. If they do not change the way in which  they behave, I think there are going to be increasing questions  about the relevance of the body."
In its 50th annual report, Amnesty said the vocal support by  many global powers in the early months of the Arab Spring in 2011  had not translated into action, with many international leaders now  looking the other way.
In Syria the group said there was a "clear and compelling case"  for alleged crimes against humanity by Bashar Al-Assad's regime to  be referred to the International Criminal Court.
"The determination of some UN Security Council members to shield  Syria at any cost leaves accountability for these crimes elusive  and is a betrayal of the Syrian people," said Shetty.
Russia and China have vetoed two Council resolutions which  condemned Assad, and they fiercely oppose UN sanctions.
"Two countries that are among the top six arms dealers in the  world, who are permanent members of the Security Council, may have  been voting much more with their pocket in mind," said Widney  Brown, senior director of international law and policy at Amnesty.
Amnesty said it was the conference on a global treaty limiting  the arms trade in July that would really show whether UN member  states were willing to take on serious challenges.
The conference is set for July 2-27 in New York. It follows an  agreement in 2009 by most of the world's major weapons exporters,  including the United States, to seek a treaty that strengthens  controls on the trade.
"The UN meeting to agree an Arms Trade Treaty in July will be an  acid test for politicians to place rights over self-interest and  profit," the Amnesty report said.
"Without a strong treaty, the UN Security Council's guardianship  of global peace and security seems doomed to failure; its permanent  members wielding an absolute veto on any resolution despite being  the world's largest arms suppliers."
