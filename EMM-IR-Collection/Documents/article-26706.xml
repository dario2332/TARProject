  <text>Two men have been arrested in Belfast about a murder in the Irish Republic in 1998.
Thomas Lockard, 34, from the Malone Road in Belfast but living in Dublin, was bound, tortured and stabbed to death near the border in Co Louth.
Police Service of Northern Ireland detectives working with Irish police arrested the suspects, aged 50 and 51, as part of a renewed investigation.
Mr Lockard disappeared from his home in south Belfast on April 25 1998 and his badly beaten body was found two days later at the side of a road at Raskeagh, near Dundalk.
PSNI detectives made the arrests following a review of the case by the Garda serious crime review team and police in Dundalk, Co Louth. Both police services are working closely together on the investigation, which is being led by the PSNI.
The suspects are being questioned at a police station in Belfast. Detectives from An Garda Siochana are assisting.
