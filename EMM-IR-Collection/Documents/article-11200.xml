DAMASCUS: Syrian forces were locked in fierce gunfights with rebels in one city and shelled another yesterday,  just hours after the first UN peacekeepers arrived to oversee a truce aimed at ending a year of bloodshed.
President Bashar al-Assad's forces killed two civilians in the central city of Hama and were fighting rebels at Idlib in the north-west, while also shelling the flashpoint city of Homs, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Since a UN-backed ceasefire came into force at dawn on Thursday, at least 41 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in violence that prompted the UN chief, Ban Ki-moon, to urge Syria to ensure the truce does not collapse.
An advance team of six international observers arrived in Damascus late on Sunday, the United Nations said. The delegation - the first of 30 monitors the UN Security Council approved on Saturday - will set up a headquarters and prepare routines so the mission can verify a cessation of hostilities is holding.
''They've arrived and they will start work [on Monday] morning,'' the UN peacekeeping department spokesman, Kieran Dwyer, said. ''The other monitors in the advance party are still expected in Syria in coming days.''
The next 25 would come from missions around the Middle East and Africa ''so we can move people quickly and they are experienced in the region'', he said.
Their mission is just one part of the six-point peace plan that Mr Assad agreed with the UN-Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan.
The former UN secretary general wants more than 200 observers  in Syria, but the Security Council has said there would only be a full mission if the violence halts.
The government news agency SANA said Syria ''welcomes'' the observer mission, and hoped the monitors would see for themselves the ''crimes'' committed by ''armed terrorist groups''.
They face a perilous task, with Western nations doubting the Assad regime's commitment to the ceasefire.
