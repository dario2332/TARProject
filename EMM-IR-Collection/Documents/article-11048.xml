  <text>Coordinated attacks by Taliban insurgents across Afghanistan showed an intelligence failure on the part of both Afghan and NATO forces, President Hamid Karzai said Monday.
"The terrorists' infiltration in Kabul and other provinces is an intelligence failure for us and especially for NATO and should be seriously investigated," Karzai said in a statement.
Afghan defence ministry says 32 insurgents killed in attacks 
Afghan security forces killed 32 insurgents and arrested one more in operations to stop coordinated attacks by Taliban insurgents that hit the capital of Kabul and three other provinces, the defence ministry said on Monday.
Three Afghan soldiers were killed and ten others wounded in fighting in Kabul that began around midday on Sunday and ended on Monday morning, defence ministry officials said.
Taliban assault in Kabul 'ended'
Fighting in the Afghan capital has finally ended, 18 hours after the Taliban launched their assault, officials have said.
A spokesman for Kabul's police chief said the last gunman, who was fighting near the parliament in the west of the city, was killed early on Monday. Earlier, security forces flushed out insurgents in the central diplomatic area, home to several embassies.
On Sunday as a result of fierce firefights and several bombings that broke out in Kabul and other Afghan cities, 19 Taliban extremists were killed, two were arrested and 14 policemen and 9 civilians were wounded according to a statement by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Attackers also carried out raids in the provinces of Logar, Paktia and Nangarhar.
In Kabul, foreign embassies, Nato's HQ and the Afghan parliament were hit in the first major attack on the city in more than six months.
The Taliban said the co-ordinated attacks were part of the start of their "spring offensive" and their response to recent claims by Nato officials that the insurgency was weak.
Clashes between radical Taliban militants and Afghan security forces continued on Sunday evening in three districts of Kabul according to information released by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Ghulam Sadiq Sadeqi.
According to him, as a result of a series of terrorist attacks, carried out by insurgents in the Afghan capital, preliminary reports say that 17 extremists were killed and 17 police officers were injured with 14 civilians also suffering injuries.
Security forces managed to arrest two terrorists in Kabul.
The Taliban has carried out a massive campaign of terror in Kabul and other cities with attacks by suicide bombers being very well coordinated.
What is happening confirms the statement by the leaders of the Taliban, regarding the beginning of a spring offensive.
Afghanistan still terrorized by Taliban
This Sunday, the Taliban attacked Kabul and several other places in Afghanistan.
In Kabul, they attacked the embassies of the US, the UK and Germany, the president's palace, the UN mission and the headquarters of the Afghanistan International Security Assistance Force.
Fights are still under way in Kabul. A US diplomat says that the police can hardly stand against the militants' onslaught.
There have been reports that the Russian embassy in Kabul was also attacked, but later, the Russian ambassador Andrey Avetisyan denied this. He says that none of the embassy's workers has suffered.
There are reports that the Taliban have stormed the parliament building.
However, in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktia, the police managed to repel the terrorists' attacks.
In the province of Logar, the militants attacked the police's headquarters, the offices of the local administration and a NATO's base. Several people were killed and some others wounded.
It should be noted that the terrorists are well organized.
Some time ago, the Taliban promised to start mass attacks in spring.
