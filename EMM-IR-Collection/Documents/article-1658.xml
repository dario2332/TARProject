DAMASCUS: Syria said yesterday it would agree to allow Arab League observers into the country as part of a plan to end almost nine months of bloodshed, but placed a number of conditions, including the cancellation of deeply embarrassing economic sanctions. Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby rebuffed the demands.
Syria has already failed to meet several League deadlines to end the crackdown which the UN says has killed more than 4,000 people since March.
Activists said security forces  killed at least 12 people yesterday, most of them in Homs.
