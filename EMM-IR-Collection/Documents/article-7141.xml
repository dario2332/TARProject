Syrian soldiers continued their attacks on the rebel city of Homs today hours after the passing of a deadline of a UN peace agreement to pull troops and heavy weaponry out of built-up areas.
Videos showed tanks remaining on the streets and shells being fired on the already battered central city amid claims that up to 1,000 people have been killed across the country in the last eight days.
In one film, posted on YouTube today, the commentator screams in Arabic 'This is Homs and there is meant to be a truce' as a building opposite him was blasted by shells.

Fighting, which has intensified in the run-up to peace deadlines, killed 30 people in the country today - including 26 in Homs, which has borne the brunt of the brutal crackdown. it was claimed.
Across Syria, 160 people died yesterday and over the last eight days 1,000 lives have been lost, the opposition also said.
Under UN peace envoy Kofi Annan's 
plan, a Syrian troop pullback from towns and villages was to be 
completed today, with all hostilities to end by 6am on Thursday.
However, although the exact death toll cannot be verified, there is little evidence that government troops are retreating. Observers said Mareh, in the northwest, was also shelled today.
A spokeswoman for the Syrian National Council says troops loyal to President Bashar Assad have intensified their onslaught in opposition areas despite saying it would accept the plan.
Bassma Kodmani said regime forces have used heavy weapons including anti-aircraft guns against civilians and that the humanitarian situation on the ground is 'dramatically deteriorating'.
Foreign Secretary William Hague led international condemnation stressing there was no evidence the regime was prepared to honour the agreement to pull its troops out of Syria's main urban centres.
He accused it of using the deal - brokered by former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan - as cover for a renewed military effort to crush the opposition.
'They have ruthlessly subjected whole communities to an inhumane campaign of shelling, forced expulsions and executions,' he said.
Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan accused Assad of personal responsibility for killing civilians and warned he would take unspecified steps after Syrian troops shot at refugees inside Turkey.
'He is continuing to kill 60, 70, 80, 100 every day,' Erdogan said of Assad, whom he once called a friend but whose troops were now, the Turkish premier said, 'mercilessly' shooting fleeing women and children in the back.
It comes as funerals were held for three people in Turkey who were killed after soldiers loyal to president Bashar al-Assad fired into a refugee camp there yesterday.
