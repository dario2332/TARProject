Thousands of people have taken to the streets for a second day to protest against the sluggish pace of political reform in Egypt following the revolution.
Demonstrators are demanding that the military quickly announce a date to hand power to an elected government.
Reports said at least three people were dead following an army assault on protesters in Cairo's central square on Sunday. It comes after two people were killed on Saturday.
More than 600 others were injured in clashes after riot police stormed Tahrir Square to clear a protest camp, officials said.
Officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas and hit demonstrators with batons in the Egyptian capital.
