  <text>Moscow (CNN) -- Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was arrested at an anti-government rally in Moscow Tuesday, he told CNN by phone.
The former deputy prime minister turned government opponent was detained at a demonstration against the results of Sunday's parliamentary elections, which returned Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's party to power with a greatly diminished majority.
The opposition Other Russia party sent out invitations to the protest via Facebook under the title "Is the Revolution Continuing? Yes!"
About 800 people said they were coming to the rally, which was due to start at 7 p.m. (10 a.m. ET).
Putin's United Russia is holding a separate rally. Police said there were about 8,000 people there.
Russian security forces were on high alert pending the results of the elections, the Interior Ministry said. Officials did not say how many extra security forces were deployed or what units they were from.
Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for a "full investigation" of irregularities in the elections, citing "serious concern" about the vote.
Shortly after she spoke, the Central Election Commission announced that Putin's party suffered a large loss of seats in the election.
United Russia will have 238 seats, down from more than 300 in the outgoing parliament, or Duma, Central Election Commission head Vladimir Churov announced, with 99.99% of ballots counted.
That will give them a slim majority in the 450-seat house.
United Russia polled just under 50%, preliminary results showed earlier.
The Communist party will have 92 seats, A Just Russia will have 64, and the Liberal Democrats will have 56, Churov said.
Thousands of people protested against the election results Monday in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported, calling the Moscow event the largest opposition demonstration in years.
People shouted "Putin is a thief!" and "Putin go away!" at the Moscow rally, which was attended by more than 5,000 people, photographer Irina Kruchkova said.
She said a "huge amount of people" had shown up, mostly middle-class people aged 25 to 40 who heard about the demonstration online.
About 300 people were arrested in Moscow, RIA Novosti reported, and about 120 people were detained in St. Petersburg.
Clinton was speaking as ministers met at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose election monitors also criticized the voting.
The group was expected to discuss a draft report by the organization's election-observer mission. It details alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors.
A preliminary OSCE report on the election said some political parties had been prevented from running and that the vote was "slanted in favor of the ruling party."
The group, which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights in Europe, cited the lack of an independent body running the election or an impartial media.
And there was "undue interference of state authorities" in the vote, the 56-member OSCE said in a statement.
As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov looked on, Clinton told the group the United States had "serious concern about the conduct of the elections," and called for an investigation of reported fraud and intimidation.
"The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted," Clinton said. "And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them."
