  <text>(CNN) -- The party of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has requested a change in the wording of the oath that lawmakers have to take, presenting a potential hurdle to her taking up the parliamentary seat she won this month.
The National League for Democracy has asked the authorities to adjust the wording of the oath to say that parliamentarians will "abide by the law" rather than "protect the constitution," Nyan Win, a spokesman for the party, said Wednesday.
Suu Kyi, 66, said in a speech last month that the country's present constitution "does not conform" with democratic norms and should be changed where needed. She also said she would change the configuration of the parliament in which 25% of seats help the military establishment.
Suu Kyi's party won 43 of the 44 seats it contested in by-elections on April 1. She is scheduled to attend her first session of parliament on Monday after she was elected in the constituency of Kawhmu.
Nyan Win said the NLD was waiting for Myanmar authorities to respond to the request. He declined to say what Suu Kyi and the other elected members of the party would do if the oath wasn't changed before the parliament session began.
"We believe this problem will be overcome," he said.
News of the complication emerged as Norway announced that Suu Kyi would visit the country in June, her first overseas trip since she was released from decades of house arrest in 2010.
"We can confirm that she will come here in June, and we are very happy about that," Svein Michelsen, a spokesman for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Wednesday.
Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, but she was unable to travel to Oslo to receive it because she was under house arrest. Her son, Alexander Aris, delivered an acceptance speech on her behalf.
Myanmar's authoritarian military rulers have begun loosening their grip on power, after decades in which dissent was stifled and freedoms severely limited.
In the past 12 months, the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a ceasefire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the by-elections that took place this month as "an important step in Burma's democratic transformation."
Western governments have applauded the elections and the other recent reforms by the government of President Thein Sein. The U.S. and Australian governments both eased some sanctions on Myanmar this week, and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain visited the country last week.
Cameron met with Suu Kyi in Yangon and invited her to visit Britain.
Clinton visited Myanmar in December -- a historic trip marking the first time a secretary of state had been to the country in more than 50 years.
And in another sign of improving ties between Myanmar's government and other countries, Thein Sein will visit Japan later this week, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday. While there, Thein Sein will meet with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.
While control of parliament will not change despite the opposition's strong performance in the by-elections this month, the result nonetheless gives the NLD a notable presence in the country's parliament.
Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).
Suu Kyi led her party to a landslide victory the previous time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. But the junta ignored the results and placed her under house arrest.
Released in November 2010, Suu Kyi was allowed to crisscross the country to rally support for the NLD at the elections.
