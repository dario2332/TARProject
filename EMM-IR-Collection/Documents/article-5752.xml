  <text>DAMASCUS: UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan expects the Syrian government and the opposition to fully implement a truce by April 12, his spokesman said on Thursday, as fighting raged near the capital Damascus.
"What we expect on April 10 is that the Syrian government will have completed its withdrawal from populated centres ... and then we begin a 48-hour period during which there will be a complete cessation of all forms of violence by all parties," Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told reporters in Geneva.
"So the clock starts ticking on the 10th on both sides to cease all forms of violence," he added.
The Syrian regime has told Annan that it has begun withdrawing troops from some parts of the country, said Fawzi, adding that "we are in the process of verification."
Annan said on Monday that President Bashar al-Assad had agreed to "immediately" start pulling his troops out of protest cities and complete a troop and heavy weapons withdrawal by April 10.
The pro-government daily Al-Watan however quoted a government official as saying Damascus is not bound by a deadline to withdraw its troops from strife-torn areas.
"There is no set date or deadline," the unnamed official said.
"April 10 is the date set for the beginning, not the end, of the withdrawal of troops and it does not constitute a deadline."
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was no sign of troop withdrawals and to the contrary, regime troops backed by tanks Thursday launched fresh assaults on rebel strongholds, including a dawn raid on the town of Douma, near Damascus.
The Britain-based monitoring group said clashes between soldiers and rebel forces were reported in various parts of Douma, located 13 kilometres (seven miles) northeast of the capital.
Two young men were killed in Kfar Sousa, a neighbourhood of Damascus early Thursday when security forces opened fire on their car, it said.
Clashes were reported in several towns of Aleppo province, including Andan and Hritan where messages on loudspeakers urged regime troops to defect and join the opposition, the Observatory said.
Violence across the country has left at least 170 people dead so far this week, monitors said, as Washington slammed an "intensification" of violence against regime opponents.
They will "begin discussing with the Syrian authorities the modalities of the eventual deployment of this UN supervision and monitoring mission," said Fawzi.
The peacekeeping mission would therefore be "ready to move in as soon as we have a Security Council resolution," he added.
Meanwhile, Annan will also travel on April 11 to Tehran, where he is to seek support from the Syrian ally for his peace plan.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the West against issuing ultimatums to Damascus.
The surge in violence has sent Syrians fleeing, with an official in Ankara saying on Thursday that more than 1,000 people had crossed the border in the past 24 hours, bringing to nearly 21,000 the number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey.
"A total of 1,043 Syrians made their way to Turkey in a single day, marking the highest figure in recent times," the official said on condition of anonymity.
