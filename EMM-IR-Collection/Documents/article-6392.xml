  <text>DAMASCUS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The international community's peace efforts are being closely watched as a United Nations (UN) planning team arrived here Thursday to prepare for the potential deployment of observers.
The observers would try to halt the violence and fully implement the UN's six-point peace plan in the country.
Syrian Defense Minister General Dawoud Rajha on Thursday called for a stop to the criminal acts by armed terrorist groups as the UN team led by Norwegian Major General Robert Mood arrived, according to Syria's state-run SANA news agency.
Speaking at a military graduation ceremony, Rajha said Syria has showed it wanted to contribute to the success of the international efforts, stressing that any political dialogue or process will not succeed if there are terrorists who spread anarchy in the country.
The defense minister also said that most of the conspiracies against Syria have been thwarted, adding that the country has managed the crisis well by issuing a package of reforms that will guarantee a better future for Syria.
Kofi Annan, the UN and Arab League joint special envoy for Syria, told the UN General Assembly Thursday that "a cessation of violence is an important beginning" in bringing peace to Syria, calling on both the Syrian government and the opposition to observe the deadline to end the fighting.
"We must commence a comprehensive political dialogue between the Syrian government and the whole spectrum of the Syrian opposition," Annan said."This must enable a Syrian-led political transition to a democratic, plural political system, in which citizens are equal regardless of their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs."
The UN chief welcomed a presidential statement adopted earlier on Thursday by the UN Security Council to support his April 10 deadline for ceasefire on the part of the Syrian government to bring an early end to the year-long crisis in the country.
Meanwhile, Syria's UN Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari told a press conference at the UN headquarters in New York Thursday that the Syrian government is committed to the six-point peace plan proposed by Annan and supported by the UN Security Council, and that Annan is being updated on a daily basis by the Syrian Foreign Ministry on the peace plan.
Annan's six-point plan calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons and troops from population centers, a daily halt to the fighting for the delivery of humanitarian aid and treatment of the wounded, as well as talks between the government and opposition.
The Syrian government has accepted Annan's six-point plan and the April 10 deadline to put an early end to the fighting in the Middle East country, which has been plunged into the crisis since March 2011.
However, on Thursday the Syrian Foreign Ministry dismissed the remarks made by the UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay as "mere lies." Pillay had said there is enough evidence to bring charges against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
In a statement issued by SANA, the ministry accused Pillay of "turning a blind eye to the terrorism practiced against the Syrian people" by armed terrorist groups.
During an interview with BBC on March 28, Pillay said that Syria's security forces have conducted a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population."
"President Assad could simply issue an order to stop the killings and the killings would stop," she said.
The Syrian government is facing growing international pressure to end the alleged crackdown on opposition strongholds, as the United Nations said more than 9,000 people had been killed over the yearlong crisis.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced Thursday it has been granted permission by the Syrian government to expand activities in the unrest-hit country, including visiting detention centers.
The committee, in a statement carried by the private Syria-news website, described the agreement as expressing the Syrian government's confidence in the Red Cross' even-handed and independent work.
According to the ICRC, the Syrian government agreed to grant a broader presence to the Red Cross after talks between ICRC head Jakob Kellenberger and senior Syrian officials, including Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, held on Wednesday in the Syrian capital of Damascus.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday that the cessation of violence in Syria is of utmost importance for the international community.
"There can be no higher priority at this moment than stopping the bloodshed in Syria," Ban said.
The Syrian government has said that it will stop military operations by April 10.
