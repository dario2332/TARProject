KABUL: Explosions and gunfire rocked the Afghan capital Kabul Sunday as suicide bombers struck across Afghanistan in coordinated attacks claimed by Taliban insurgents as the start of a spring offensive.
A total of 19 insurgents died and 14 police and nine civilians were wounded, the Interior Ministry said.
Embattled President Hamid Karzai was moved to a safe area and his palace went into lockdown as the capital was hit by a wave of attacks including a failed attempt to target one of his deputies, officials said.
In Kabul the insurgents took up positions in construction sites overlooking government buildings, diplomatic missions and other high profile targets, unleashing a stand-off with security forces throughout the afternoon and into the night.
They claimed they were linked to the Haqqani Network, he said, a hardcore Taliban branch accused of masterminding most of the high-profile attacks in Kabul and known to have close links to al Qaeda.
The attacks will raise fears over the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as NATO prepares to withdraw its 130,000 troops by the end of 2014 and hand responsibility for security to Afghan forces.
But the latest in a series of spectacular attacks shows militants still have the ability to strike at the heart of the capital, including ISAF bases.
Outside the capital, militants attacked government buildings in Logar province, the airport in Jalalabad, and a police facility in the town of Gardez in Paktya province, where a NATO helicopter was reportedly deployed against them.
Zabihullah Mujahed, the Taliban spokesman, told AFP by phone from an unknown location, that the attacks were a message to the Kabul government and its Western military backers.
Several attackers tried to storm the Afghan parliament but were engaged by security forces and driven back, parliamentary media officer Qudratullah Jawid told AFP.
MP Mohammad Naeem Lalai told AFP lawmakers joined the security forces in firing on militants as they tried to enter parliament, which was in session.
In September last year Taliban attacks targeting locations including the US embassy and headquarters of foreign troops in Kabul killed at least 14 during a 19-hour siege. And in August, nine people were killed when suicide bombers attacked the British Council cultural centre.
19 Taliban killed and 14 brave afghan policemen injured. Results are much better than what happened in Pakistan where Taliban got away with 400 terrorists with no causalities on either side.
Taliban and Pakistan establishment both are on the same side of the coin, not even other side of the same coin.
