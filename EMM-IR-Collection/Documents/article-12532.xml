  <text>Officials said extremists launched nine attacks in Baghdad and the northern cities of Kirkuk, Dibis and Taji.
At least 71 people were wounded in the rapid-fire explosions that unfolded over an hour and 15 minutes.
The deadliest bombing came in Dibis, near Kirkuk, 280km north of Baghdad. Kirkuk police said a parked car exploded in the Sunni Arab village, killing six passers-by and wounding four.
Bystanders took the brunt of the attacks that killed eight across the Iraqi capital, mostly in Shiite neighbourhoods.
Two explosions in Kirkuk targeted a police patrol and the provincial investment official, killing three and wounding 21.
A roadside bomb in the city of Taji, just north of Baghdad, exploded as a security patrol drove by. One bystander was killed and three policemen were among six people wounded.
The explosions ended nearly a month of quiet in Iraq, where violence waned after the run-up to the Arab League summit in Baghdad at the end of March.
Overall, attacks have dropped sharply nationwide since Iraq threatened to dissolve into civil war five years ago, but bombings and shootings are still common.
