  <text>Hamas police officers carried posters of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails during a protest in Gaza City on Monday.
JERUSALEM &amp;mdash; Palestinian officials said Monday that an Egyptian-brokered deal with Israel to end a  hunger strike by hundreds of Palestinian prisoners awaited only the prisoners' approval.

Two of the hunger strikers have gone without food for 75 days to protest their incarceration without formal charges. More than 1,600 prisoners, about a third of all the Palestinian prisoners, have joined the strike since mid-April, posing an acute problem for Israel and raising fears of a violent backlash in the event of a prisoner's death.
Issa Qaraqe, the minister of prisoner affairs for the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, said that the leaders of the strike were due to meet with Israeli Prison Service officials inside one of the prisons to respond to the provisions formulated in Cairo over the past few days.
Mr. Qaraqe told Voice of Palestine Radio that there were "positive signals" because Israel had accepted three of the prisoners' main demands: to restrict the military courts' ability to extend the terms of some 300 inmates being held without charge or trial under what is known as administrative detention; to end the solitary confinement of 17 prisoners who have been kept in isolation; and to permit family visits for prisoners in the West Bank who come from Gaza.
Azzam al-Ahmed, the envoy holding talks in Cairo on behalf of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, told the radio station that the draft agreement was awaiting the prisoners' approval.
Hamas officials of the rival government in Gaza also said on Monday that an agreement was near.
Israel officials refused to comment before an agreement had been sealed.
The bulk of the prisoners have been demanding improved conditions and the restoration of rights that were suspended while an Israeli soldier was held captive in Gaza. That soldier, Gilad Shalit, was released last October in a prisoner exchange that was also brokered by Egypt.
But a more fundamental goal of the strikers has been to challenge the Israeli military courts' practice of administrative detention, which has been used against thousands of Palestinians over time.
Israel has said that administrative detention is essential for security, particularly in cases where exposing evidence would compromise intelligence sources. Administrative detention orders can apply for up to six months, but they can also be renewed repeatedly. Some Palestinians have been held on secret evidence for years.
But Israeli authorities have shown some flexibility in individual cases. Khader Adnan, a Palestinian administrative detainee, ended a 66-day fast this year after the Israeli authorities agreed to release him a few weeks early and pledged not to renew his detention in the absence of any new evidence against him. Another hunger striker, Hana Shalabi, 30, from the West Bank, was released early after more than 40 days without eating and was sent into temporary exile in Gaza.
Egyptian mediation was necessary because many of the striking prisoners hail from groups with which Israel has no direct contact, including Hamas, the Islamic group based in Gaza that refuses to recognize Israel, and the even more militant Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad was the main force behind the firing of rockets out of Gaza against southern Israel in recent months.
The two hunger strikers who have fasted the longest, Bilal Diab, 27, and Thaer Halahleh, 33, are both accused of working with Islamic Jihad.
In another complicating factor, direct peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been suspended for more than 18 months.
A minority of the hunger strikers are identified with Mr. Abbas's mainstream, secularist Fatah Party. But Mr. Abbas has taken the lead in pressing for a resolution of the crisis. Mr. Abbas, who recently asked Israel to release prisoners as a gesture of good will, said this weekend that the death of a hunger striker could be "disastrous" and that the security system could collapse.
The prisoners and their struggle occupy a special place in Palestinian society and solidarity protests have been growing. The Palestinian Authority and Israel fear an outburst of popular anger that might be difficult to contain.
The sides seemed intent on finalizing a deal before Tuesday when the Palestinians commemorate "the nakba," or catastrophe. Traditionally a day of protest marches, it marks the anniversary of Israel's declaration of independence in 1948 and the war in which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians became refugees through expulsion and flight.
Before noon on Monday, thousands of Palestinians marched through Gaza City's Omar Mukhtar Street and into the square of the Unknown Soldier, carrying green Hamas flags and pictures of hunger-striking prisoners as they chanted revolutionary rhetoric. They marched in three groups: first the men, many of them police officers in military garb, with guns and red and green berets; then the women, led by a phalanx who wore fluorescent yellow security vests over their black abayas, holding hands; and finally schoolboys, shouting, "With the blood and with our soul we are ready to ransom the prisoners."
The rally surrounded a tent that has stood in the square for several weeks, and was filled on Monday with scores of men and women on sympathy hunger strikes, lying in cots. Some held photographs of their prisoner-sons, or, in some cases, they held laptops and cellphones.
One Hamas leader told the crowd that a deal was imminent and would be signed within hours in Cairo. But, he added, "the battle will not stop."
"The battle will continue," he said, "not only until Israel accepts the demands of the prisoners but until it will free them."
Ahmad Bahar, the leader of the Hamas legislators in Gaza's Parliament, criticized the United Nations and Arab and Islamic leaders from around the region for not acting quickly or strongly enough on behalf of the striking prisoners. But his strongest words were saved for the Israeli leaders, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Shaul Mofaz, the former head of the opposition who joined Mr. Netanyahu's government last week.
"Netanyahu is a criminal, Mofaz is a criminal," Mr. Bahar said. "We will win at the end, our prisoners will win. We will remain on this land and you will go. The land of Palestine will be liberated by blood and not by negotiations."
