  <text>SURKHROD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Around 1,000 people, mostly students, took to the streets in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday to protest against plans for a long-term partnership deal with the United States, which they fear could lead to an extended presence of U.S. troops.
Afghan political and community leaders endorsed the idea of a strategic partnership, with some caveats, after a 2,000-strong national gathering, or loya jirga, which ended on Saturday.
The demonstrators gathered just outside the capital of eastern Nangarhar province and burnt an effigy of U.S. President Barack Obama as they protested against the prospect of U.S. troops remaining in Afghanistan.
All foreign combat troops are currently slated to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, with security nationwide to be handed over to the national police and army. However, other foreign advisers will remain to work with Afghan forces.
"We are totally against any American presence in Afghanistan, they kill our people in their arbitrary operations," said university student Mohammad Tahir Qane.
Other protesters carried banners and shouted "death to America, death to American slaves."
One, 22-year-old Gul Khan, said: "We don't want to be the slaves of Americans forever, our patience is running out. If this pact is signed, we will take to the streets every day."
There were some major qualifications on the jirga's support for a pact, however.
In a declaration made after the meeting, delegates said they opposed a permanent U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and wanted the United States to stop carrying out night raids.
Ethiopia did it five years ago, the Americans a while back. Now Kenya has rolled tanks and troops across its arid frontier into lawless Somalia, in another campaign to stamp out a rag-tag militia of Islamist rebels that has stoked terror throughout the region with threats of strikes.  Blog
