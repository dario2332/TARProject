  <text>Russia may vote for the approval of the statement by the UN Security Council Chairman on Syria, if it is in line with the plan proposed by the special envoy of the UN and Arab League on Syria Kofi Annan and contains no ultimatums or threats, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during his visit to Kyrgyzstan.
Kofi Annan's plan envisages cease-fire by the Syrian authorities on April 10. In the coming days the UN's Security Council may approve a statement supporting this term. The new statement is being prepared by the US, the UK and France. However there is no single position on the new document among the members of the UN Security Council.  Russia finds the issue of any new documents on Syria to be unnecessary on the current stage, but it is ready to work with its partners on the draft provided that the new document is well-balanced, Lavrov said.
"We think we should work with all our partners but with the only goal: to convince them that we want to help Syrian people solve their problems independently. Our Western partners and some Arab countries prefer to encourage the Syrian opposition to do the opposite - to avoid any dialogue with the authorities. This can mean only that they will look for a solution of the conflict by means of force. At the same time it is absolutely clear that even if the opposition is armed to teeth it won't defeat the Syrian army. The military standoff will mean only years of massacre and self-destruction."
Any steps with regard to Syria must be aimed at contributing to the success of Kofi Annan's mission. The government in Damascus has agreed with Annan's proposals, begun to work on their implementation and it is very important not to hamper this process, Lavrov said. He said he regrets that some parties involved would like to see the development of other scenarios. It is enough to mention that the French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe believes that Annan's plan will fail because the Syrian president is not sincere in his statements. Washington believes that Bashar Assad's resignation is an obligatory condition for the end of the conflict.
Meanwhile the draft of the UN Security Council's statement on Syria contains not only the demand to Damascus to stop using force by April 10. It also obliges the armed opposition to stop violence within 48 hours after the Syrian government stops military actions. Experts find that such an approach is not fair and gives an advantage to the opposition. It would be fair to demand that the parties should stop the use of force simultaneously, Boris Dolgov, an expert with an Institute of Oriental Studies says.
"It is unfair demanding that it is the governmental forces that should cease fire first. The parties should do it simultaneously. Although the Syrian authorities agreed to stop military actions simultaneously with the opposition, the position of the leading Western countries, monarchies of the Persian Gulf and Turkey hampers the end of the crisis in Syria."
Gumer Isayev, an analyst with the Centre of Middle East studies shares this point of view.
"Ignoring the fact that the opposition continues to put pressure on the authorities using force is the biggest problem. Terrorist attacks, killings of servicemen continue. The demand that the Syrian government should first stop using force sounds quite abstract. It means that if the insurgents attack the troops the troops should let insurgents kill them."
It looks like peace will be restored in Syria soon. The authorities have already begun to withdraw troops from some of the regions. After April 10, the UN plans to send its monitors to Syria to watch the reconciliation process. The Smetlivy guard ship of Russia's Black Sea fleet is to carry out its peacekeeping tasks near the Syrian coast till May.  It is now sailing to the port of Tarus where the logistics base of the Russian Navy is located. The question that remains is whether the opposition follow Annan's plan. This will become clear after April 10.
