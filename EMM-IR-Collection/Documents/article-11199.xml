UNITED Nations military observers arrived in Syria to monitor a ceasefire agreement amid continued clashes between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and army defectors.
The first group of UN observers arrived in the capital, Damascus, yesterday, al-Arabiya television reported.
They are due to monitor a six-point ceasefire plan designed to end a conflict that has killed more than 9000 people since March last year, according to UN estimates.
Syria's government and opposition groups agreed to implement the truce yet both both sides have accused the other of violating it.
Dr Assad's forces engaged in ''fierce clashes'' at dawn yesterday with army defectors in the northern province of Idlib while government forces fired mortar rounds on al-Khaldiyeh and al-Bayyada neighbourhoods in the central city of the opposition stronghold of Homs, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in an emailed statement.
The observers are due to draft a report to UN special envoy Kofi Annan before a Security Council resolution is agreed, possibly next week, to deploy an additional 250 monitors, including civilians and human rights activists, according to Mr Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi.
The blue-bereted UN monitors will coordinate their mission with the Syrian government and should be granted free access to travel across the country, Mr Fawzi told al-Jazeera television.
Up to 30 monitors were expected to be in Syria by the end of the week.
Mr Annan's peace plan won backing from Russia and China, which were the two permanent member countries on the Security Council that had vetoed earlier efforts by the US and its European and Arab allies to pass a  resolution calling for Dr Assad to cede power.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem is due to travel to China for two days ''to discuss bilateral issues and the mission of Annan'', the state's Syrian Arab News Agency reported yesterday.
Syria's ceasefire appeared to  be  eroding   just hours before the arrival of the first team of UN truce monitors.
