  <text>BEIRUT, Lebanon &amp;mdash; After months of intensifying bloodshed, an uncertain cease-fire backed by the United Nations and brokered by the special envoy Kofi Annan went into effect in Syria early on Thursday with none of the by-now-familiar reports of shelling by government forces and mayhem in major cities, activists said.

But the exiled Syrian National Council opposition, which is seeking the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad, said that there were reports of raids and arrests of the government's opponents in some suburbs of Damascus and that it was not clear how long the guns would remain silent. Several hours after the cease-fire deadline, there had been no reports of major infringements, but activists said they were concerned that government troops had not returned to barracks, as stipulated in the Annan plan.
The Syrian Defense Ministry in Damascus, the capital, said a decision had been made to observe the cease-fire after government forces carried out "successful missions in combating criminal acts by armed terrorist groups" &amp;mdash; the term the authorities use to describe their armed adversaries.
But the official SANA news agency, quoting "an official source" at the ministry, said that, having "enforced the authority of the state on all its territories," the "armed forces will be on alert to confront any attack by armed terrorist groups against civilians, law-enforcement members, the armed forces and private and public facilities."
The continuing state of alert seemed to corroborate assertions by opponents of Mr. Assad that government forces had not pulled back from forward positions in some areas. Additionally, the official assertion that the army had spread state authority across the land seemed to reflect the ferocity of an onslaught in the days leading to the truce, during which activists reported scores killed.
But activists reported no fighting across the country after the deadline for the cease-fire to go into effect passed at 6 a.m. local time.
Abu Rami, an activist reached via Skype in the embattled city of Homs, said there had been no gunfire, shelling or other attacks for several hours.
"That followed a very bloody night, but the early morning has been very quiet," he said, noting that there was often a lull around dawn so more time was needed to see if it really was a cease-fire. The security forces' checkpoints still dotted the city and soldiers were still fully deployed, he said. 
A spokesman for the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the calm endured for an hour after the deadline for the cease-fire. "It is quiet in every region," he said, adding that "a few explosions" had been heard in the town of Zabadani just outside Damascus. Other activists said the explosions there had been heard before the cease-fire went into effect.
As the truce approached, Mr. Assad's forces appeared to be ignoring a central stipulation of Mr. Annan's plan requiring government troops to pull back from major population centers 48 hours before the guns were supposed to fall silent.
"There has not been any movement indicating a withdrawal of tanks," the spokesman for the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
An activist in Homs, identified only as Yazan, told Reuters: "Snipers, tanks and soldiers are still there. They haven't gone anywhere. People are wary and they believe that this ceasefire is only temporary. Nobody is leaving their home."
Basma Kodmani, a spokeswoman of the Syrian National Council in Geneva, said she there had been two cases of tank fire and one person killed, but the country was generally quieter, Reuters said.
The cease-fire was supposed to halt violence that started 13 months ago with an uprising against Mr. Assad's rule. Since then, it has turned into the most violent government crackdown on dissent of the Arab revolts against despotic rulers that took root last year. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died.
