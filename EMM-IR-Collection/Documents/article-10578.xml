  <text>A wide swath of the central U.S. is in a severe storm danger zone on Sunday, following twisters that killed at least five people and caused damage across the Midwest on Saturday.
The areas "most likely" to see tornadoes by Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service said, are northeast Iowa, southeast Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin.
"Severe storms are also possible in a band from Illinois and Missouri southward into Arkansas, northwest Louisiana and east Texas," the service added.
Saturday saw 122 reports of tornadoes in the central plains, the Storm Prediction Center noted. Not all have been confirmed, and some might be the same twister reported in a nearby area, but the number of reports is unusually high.
Below's a look at the deaths, injuries and damage by state.
Oklahoma: In Woodward, five people were killed by a twister that also leveled buildings.
Lightning had apparently disabled the town's tornado sirens, Reuters cited Mayor Roscoe Hill as saying.
Two children died at a mobile home park, while two adults were killed just outside the city limits, Hill said.
"This thing took us by surprise," Hill said, adding storm sirens had not  sounded. "It's kind of overwhelming."
In April 1947, Woodward was hit by a tornado that still ranks as the deadliest in  Oklahoma history, with 116 people killed, according to the National Weather  Service.

Kansas: A twister churned through parts of Wichita, where Brandon Redmond, a meteorologist with the Severe Weather Alert Team, said it passed over his vehicle and lifted it two feet off the ground.
"The tornado literally formed over  our vehicle," he told Reuters. "I've never been that scared in my life. ... We  had power flashes all around us and debris circulating all around the vehicle,  sheet metal, parts of a roof, plywood."
The city's industrial south side saw significant damage, he added, as did a mobile home park. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Tornadoes also raced through north-central Kansas. Five homes in rural  Saline County were damaged, but the tornado  avoided towns and no one  was hurt.
Iowa: A  hospital in Creston was  damaged and two people were injured by a suspected twister. Patients were moved to nearby hospitals and most of the town of 7,500 people lost power.
In Thurman, a town of 250, homes were missing walls and roofs, while sidewalks and streets were covered with toppled trees.
"I would estimate a fourth of the houses have been made  unlivable," said Randy Chapman, a deputy at the Fremont  County Sheriff's Office.
Nebraska: An apparent tornado near Oxford took a roof off a farm house and toppled a grain bin but no injuries or  other serious damage in the area were reported.
Tornadoes briefly  touched down earlier in Nebraska's Nuckolls County and Thayer County.
The U.S. tornado season started early this year, with twisters already  blamed  for 62 deaths in 2012 in the Midwest and South, raising concerns  that this year  would be a repeat of 2011, the deadliest tornado year  in nearly a century.
Some 550 people died in tornadoes last year, including 316 killed in an   April outbreak in five Southern states, and 161 people in Joplin,  Missouri, the  following month.
The Storm Prediction Center, part of the National Weather Service, had warned of Saturday's developing system.
Director Russ Schneider said it was just  the second time in U.S. history that the center issued a high-risk warning more  than 24 hours in advance. The first was in April 2006, when nearly 100 tornadoes  tore across the Southeast, killing a dozen people and damaging more than  1,000 homes in Tennessee.
Earlier warnings are now possible because storm  modeling and technology have improved, said Chris Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather  Service. In the past, people often have had only minutes of warning when a siren  went off.
The National Weather Service also announced  last month that it would start using terms like "mass devastation,"  "unsurvivable" and "catastrophic" in tornado warnings in an effort to get more people to  take heed.
