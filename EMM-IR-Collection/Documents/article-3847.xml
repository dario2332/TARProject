  <text>UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan on Monday briefed the UN Security Council on his efforts to halt the bloodshed in Syria amid new shelling of opposition strongholds by government forces.
Diplomats said Annan spoke to the 15-member council by videoconference from Geneva. The meeting was held behind closed doors.
Annan has proposed a six-point plan to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad on halting the more than a year of violence which the UN says has left more than 9,000 dead.
Assad has accepted the plan but death toll has continued to mount. More attacks were reported in Homs and other cities on Monday, and there are new signs of international divisions on Syria.
Arab nations have called for a deadline for Assad to implement the plan but Russia, Syria's main ally, has rejected this.-AFP/NOW Lebanon
