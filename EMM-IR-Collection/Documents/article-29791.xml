  <text>Twelve men released unharmed amid growing concern Syrian unrest has spread to neighbouring Lebanon
A group of Lebanese Shia Muslims kidnapped in Syria have been released in good health on Friday, three days after Syrian rebels abducted the men as they returned from a religious pilgrimage, officials said.
The kidnappings fuelled fears Lebanon was being drawn into the bloody conflict in neighbouring Syria. In the hours after the abductions, protests erupted in Beirut's Shia-dominated southern suburbs, where residents burned tyres and blocked roads.
Lebanon's prime minister, Najib Mikati, confirmed the men had been released, adding that they were "in good health and on their way to Beirut". Officials from both countries claimed Syrian rebels were responsible for the kidnappings.
The pilgrims, described as 11 Lebanese and a Syrian driver, were believed to have been returning from a trip to Iranian holy sites when they were abducted.
Sunnis have formed the backbone of the Syrian revolt, raising sectarian tensions. The country's president, Bashar al-Assad, and the ruling elite belong to the tiny Alawite sect, a Shia offshoot.
Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shia militant group, has stood by Assad as he struggles to quell the 15-month uprising. The group's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, was expected to give a speech on Friday to mark the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000.
Tuesday's kidnappings came amid rising tension in Lebanon over Syria. The countries share complex political and sectarian ties, which sometimes turn violent. Syria had troops on the ground in Lebanon for nearly 30 years until 2005 and continues to have strong ties to Lebanon's security services.
Clashes linked to the Syrian conflict have killed at least 10 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks.
Also on Friday, Syrian forces fired teargas and live ammunition to disperse thousands of protesters demanding an end to Assad's rule, killing two people in the northern city of Aleppo.
Crackdowns on protests and other government and rebel attacks are routine, despite the deployment of more than 250 UN observers across the country to monitor a ceasefire brokered by the international envoy, Kofi Annan. Despite the unrest, the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said this week there was no "plan B" for the Annan initiative.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has activists on the ground, and the opposition Local Co-ordination Committees confirmed one person was killed and another wounded in Aleppo, an economic hub which has remained largely supportive of Assad but where anti-regime sentiment has escalated in recent weeks.
Aleppo-based activist Mohammad Saeed said one of the protesters died from his injuries, raising the number of those killed in the city's volatile Boustan al-Qasr district to two.
He said more than 10,000 people had been protesting across the city: "The regime is desperately trying to put down the protests in Aleppo – but all this violence will backfire."
Amateur videos posted online by activists show several wounded people, including a teenage girl, being carried away by protesters.
