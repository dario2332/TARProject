  <text>ROME &amp;mdash; An earthquake struck the northern Italian region of Emilia Romagna on Sunday, killing at least five people, wounding dozens and damaging historic buildings as well as warehouses and factories, officials said.

An old tower was damaged in Finale Emilia.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.0 according to the United States Geological Survey, crumbled church roofs and Renaissance-era towers, officials said. Large cracks rippled through apartment blocks and villas in dozens of small towns, leaving scores homeless.
Four men working the night shift in different factories on the outskirts of the small town of Sant'Agostino died when the buildings in which they were working collapsed.
Giovanni Gregori, an earthquake expert with Italy's national research council, said on Sky News Italia that given the magnitude of the quake, the death toll "could have been much worse."
Many areas of Italy are considered to be at high risk for earthquakes. A quake in 1976 killed nearly a thousand people in Friuli Venezia Giulia, and almost 3,000 died in the Campania earthquake of 1980. Three years ago, an earthquake in the area of L'Aquila, in central Italy, killed more than 300 people. While rebuilding has advanced in many villages in the region, the historic center of L'Aquila itself remains a ghost town and there has been public outcry over delays in reconstruction there.
But in Emilia Romagna, seismic events of this kind have been more rare. Mr. Gregori said that the last quake of this magnitude in the area was in the 14th century. "For man, seven centuries are a lot, for nature it is nothing," he said.
"We're not used to events of this kind," said Giovanni Morandi, editor in chief of Il Resto Del Carlino, a local daily newspaper.
Minor aftershocks were felt in the region Sunday morning, and many churches canceled services. The main quake was felt as far away as Liguria on the country's western coast and Friuli Venezia Giulia in the east.
Areas in some of the hardest-hit towns were cordoned off while officials expressed concern about the stability of some historic towers. After an initial survey of the area's culturally relevant monuments and churches, the Italian Culture Ministry said in a note that the damage had been "extensive. Ministry experts were working with civil protection agency officials and firefighters to monitor the situation, and three state museums in Ferrara had been closed, the ministry said.
Meanwhile, engineers and surveyors traveled through the area, monitoring roads and bridges, according to Stefano Vaccari, the lawmaker who oversees the civil protection agency for the Province of Modena.
Officials said that schools would be closed for several days, and that dormitories, some with up to 1000 beds, would be set up in various towns for those in need of shelter.
