  <text>Syrian’s Muslim Brotherhood on Saturday said it “will reevaluate its policies and positions” following the “massacre” that was committed in the Syrian town of Houla on Friday.
The group said in a statement: “The brutal carnage that was committed on Friday night in Houla explicitly reflects the moral background of [President] Bashar al-Assad and his packs of humans.”
The Muslim Brotherhood also held the “the international community [and UN leader] Ban Ki-moon responsible for the terrible massacre [in Houla].”
“We consider that [UN-Arab League envoy] Kofi Annan and the [UN] observers present on ground in Syria are complicit [with those seeking to] cover the Syrian regime’s crimes, because of their ongoing silence over the violations and massacres [being committed in Syria," the Muslim Brotherhood said in its statement.
