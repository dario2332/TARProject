  <text>A masked gunman emerged from a van and fired five shots at the victims as they got into a car in the Evelyn Gardens area, at around 8.30am on Tuesday.
Mr Hales, who is believed to have been the intended target, was hit in the at least twice in the chest - his injuries have been described as life threatening.
His 18-year-old daughter was shot in the stomach and hand and is critically ill but stable in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
The attack took place as Mr Hales was taking the girl to school.
Her mother witnessed a lone masked gunman open fire outside their home, police revealed. She ran out of the house and saw the gunman escape in a small, red van.
A short time later the vehicle, which may be linked to the attack, was found burning in nearby Ballymoney Street, in the Oldpark district.
Detective Chief Inspector Karen Baxter, who is leading the investigation, said that Harry Hales was known to the police.
However she said it was too early to establish a definite motive for the attack.
"Both of them were very lucky to be alive. It is clear that the nature of this attack has no regard for humanity," DCI Baxter said.
"This is a built-up area, it's a residential area, I have no doubt early this morning there will have been people taking children to school.
"We are appealing for these people to come forward and speak to police - they will have vital information which will be important to progressing this inquiry."
I had him in the pram, and my other boy was walking - he'll be coming nine.
A neighbour of the Hales family, who lives opposite them, said she had just passed the car with her one-year-old and nine-year-old sons on their way to school when the gunman struck.
"I was very shocked," she told UTV. "I had just walked past before.
"It is very quiet up here, you don't really see many people about so I was a bit scared and a bit panicky when I heard about this."
Local politicians who have described the gun attack as "vicious" and "callous" are concerned so many children were on their way to school when the gunman opened fire.
Alliance councillor Billy Webb said: "It was a vicious and callous attack on two people in a residential area.
"I cannot comprehend the motivations behind such an attack. There can never be any justification for a crime like this."
Alban Maginness of the SDLP said: "I have been talking to the neighbours around here, two elderly neighbours and they are very shocked about what happened.
"It is a cruel blow to the family and both people have been very seriously hurt."
The DUP's Nelson McCausland said: "Whatever purpose lies behind this attack it must be condemned by all right-thinking people.
"There can be no justification for the use of guns by people intent on murder or serious injury."
Conor Maskey of Sinn Féin said: "It is a very serious and very reckless and an 18-year-old female has been shot in the process, so this is something that does not want or support and hopefully whoever did this will be caught."
Detectives hunting the gunmen have called on anyone with information, particularly anyone who saw a red van driving away from the scene, to get in touch with them.
