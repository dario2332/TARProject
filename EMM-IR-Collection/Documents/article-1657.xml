DAMASCUS: Syria said yesterday it will allow observers into the country as part of an Arab League plan to end deadly unrest, in a turnabout which could stave off crippling sanctions if its modifications are accepted. "The government responded positively to the signing of the protocol" on sending observers "based on Syrian understanding of this co-operation," foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdisi said.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem sent a message to the League on Sunday night as its deadline was set to expire, paving the way for the protocol, Makdisi said.
Damascus had refused to sign, arguing that the text contained wording that undermined its sovereignty.
The international community wants monitors to keep a check on President Bashar Al Assad's forces, accused by the United Nations of rights abuses. The UN says at least 4,000 people have been killed since March.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, meanwhile, said  seven civilians were killed and mutinous soldiers killed four security personnel, including an officer, in the southern protest hub of Dael in Daraa province. It also accused forces of arresting 18 students, eight in a high school in the coastal town of Jabla for allegedly insulting the president, and the others near Damascus for joining a protest.
Syria has asked the League for "minor changes which don't touch on the substance of the protocol and for clarifications not linked to the nature of the mission," Makdisi said. "We asked them for the names and nationalities of the observers. We hope for a positive reply. The success of this mission depends on Arab intentions."
Syria insists on the League's Charter which stipulates that member states must respect the systems of government in other member states and avoid any action to change them.
Jordan said it did not want to impose sanctions and a flight ban on its neighbour because they will harm Jordanian interests.
Official Syrian media said Damascus had suspended a free trade pact with Turkey and imposed a 30 per cent tax on Turkish imports to punish Ankara for imposing sanctions.
