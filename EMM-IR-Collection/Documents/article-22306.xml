  <text>Mood (right) said the violence will end only when Syria's factions give dialogue a chance

The head of the UN observer mission, Norwegian Major General Robert Mood, told reporters in Damascus on Friday that his team "will reach full capacity in record time." Some 260 of the planned 300 observers are currently on the ground in Syria.
"No volume of observers can achieve a progressive drop and a permanent end to the violence if the commitment to give dialogue a chance is not genuine from all internal and external factors," Major General Mood acknowledged.
"We are very committed to the Syrian people, innocent women and children, to return back to normality," the general said. "But we must be given a real chance to do that from the fighting parties and their supporters."
The UN estimates that more than 9,000 people have been killed in 15 months of violence in Syria.
