The Sydney Morning Herald
Amnesty International's The State of the World's Human Rights report for 2012, released this morning, says the 66-year-old council is unable to meet its mandate of maintaining international peace.
National Director of Amnesty's Australian arm, Claire Mallinson, said there was a clear and compelling case for the situation in Syria, in particular, to be referred to the International Criminal Court.
Australia was not spared criticism in Amnesty's assessment of global human rights.
Amnesty also said the Stronger Futures Bill - currently before the Senate and which would extend by a decade the Northern Territory Intervention first introduced by the Howard government - would marginalise and disenfranchise indigenous Australians.
The Amnesty International dossier included reports on human rights in 153 countries. At least 91 countries restricted its citizens freedom of expression, the report found, while in 101 countries people were tortured our maltreated.
Twenty-one countries carried out executions.
The Amnesty report said the UN Security Council failed to take action over conflict in Sudan, and didn't properly address human rights concerns in the Western Sahara.
It also failed to properly equip the UN Monitoring Group responsible for overseeing sanctions against Somalia and a Security Council resolution condemning crimes by the Assad regime in Syria was blocked by Russia and China.
The strongest claim to membership comes from the so-called 'G4' - Brazil, Germany, India and Japan - who support each others' bids for permanent membership of the UN's inner circle.
However, there is resistance to almost all of those countries from one quarter or another of the broader UN organisation.
Reform of the Security Council requires the agreement of two-thirds of UN member states as well as that of all five Security Council permanent members, each of whom holds a right of veto.
There is, too, widespread support for reform of the veto right, but that would require those countries holding a veto power to vote to give it up, an unlikely proposition.
