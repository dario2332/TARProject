  <text>British Prime Minister David Cameron called for sanctions against Burma to be eased after holding talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Making a historic visit to the former British colony, the prime minister insisted that moves towards democratic reform should be rewarded. He was standing alongside the Nobel Peace Prize laureate in the garden of the lakeside villa where she spent 15 years under house arrest. The prime minister said: "I think it is right to suspend the sanctions that there are against Burma - to suspend them, not lift them." Cameron continued: "[Burma] shouldn't be as poor as it is, it shouldn't have suffered under dictatorship for as long as it has and things don't have to be that way. "There is the real prospect of change and I'm very much committed to working with you in trying to help make sure that your country makes those changes. "I met with President Thein Sein today, and I think there are prospects for change in Burma, and I think it is right for the rest of the world to respond to those changes. "Of course we must respond with caution, with care, we must always be sceptical and questioning, because we want to know those changes are irreversible, but &amp;hellip; I think it is right to suspend the sanctions that there are against Burma - to suspend them, not lift them, and obviously not to include the arms embargo - because I do think it is important to send a signal that we want to help see the changes that can bring the growth of freedom, human rights and democracy in your country." Aung San Suu Kyi said: "We still have a long way to go but we believe we can get there. "I believe President Thein Sein is genuine about democratic reforms and I am very happy that Prime Minister Cameron thinks that the suspension of sanctions is the right way to respond to this. I support the &amp;hellip; suspension, rather than the lifting, of sanctions, because this would be an acknowledgement of the role of the president and other reformers.
