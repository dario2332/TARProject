  <text>Syria 'failing to keep to truce'
GetArticleDate("4/19/2012 6:11:55 AM");
The UN secretary-general says Syria has failed to comply with its obligation under a peace plan to pull troops and heavy weapons out of urban areas.
In a letter to the UN Security Council, Ban Ki-moon called for an observer mission to be expanded to 300 members.
An advance team of six observers has already gone to Syria under the plan, negotiated by UN envoy Kofi Annan.
There have been continuing reports of violence in breach of a ceasefire.
Syria had earlier said it would only accept 250 UN monitors.
