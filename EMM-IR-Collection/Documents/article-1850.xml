  <text>"This  is the first time on such an important religious day in Afghanistan  that terrorism of that horrible nature is taking place," Afghan  President Hamid Karzai told journalists in Germany, where the conference on Afghanistan's future was held.
Outside  a Kabul hospital, mourners cried near a pile of bloody clothes and  shoes. A woman in a dark headscarf clutching a bloodstained sports shoe  said her son, in his early 20s, had died. "They killed my son ... this  is his shoe," she wailed.
No one  immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabul and northern  Mazar-i-Sharif. The Taliban strongly condemned the bombings and blamed  "invader enemies."
Afghanistan has a  history of tension and violence between Sunnis and the Shi'ite  minority. But since the fall of the Taliban the country had avoided the  large scale sectarian attacks that have troubled neighboring Pakistan.
"Afghanistan  has been at war for 30 years and terrible things have happened, but one  of the things that Afghans have been spared generally has been what  appears to be this kind of very targeted sectarian attack," said Kate  Clark, from the Afghanistan Analysts Network.
"We  don't know who planted the bomb yet and it is dangerous to jump to  conclusions but if it was Taliban, it marks something really serious,  and dangerous, and very troubling."
Shortly  after the Kabul blast, a bicycle bomb exploded near the main mosque in  northern Mazar-i-Sharif city, killing four, injuring 17 others, and  sparking a fight at a university mosque where Shi'ites and Sunnis were  both praying.
"Enemies wanted to  target the Muslim precession attending prayer, but because of tight  security they failed," the city's senior police detective Abdul Raoof  Taj, told Reuters.
Four people were injured in the mosque scuffle, which broke out when worshippers began arguing about the blast.
Police  later defused a mine, found near the site of the explosion and likely  intended to target rescuers and security forces attending to victims of  the bomb.
A motorbike bomb also  appeared to be aimed at Shi'ite worshippers in southern Kandahar city,  the Taliban's spiritual home and centre of a strong push by NATO-led  troops to push the insurgents out of their stronghold.
It exploded prematurely, injuring two policemen and three civilians, but causing no deaths.
"We  cannot say for certain who the bomber's target was, but it was probably  the Ashura (ceremonies)," said Kandahar police chief Abdul Raziq.
"We have 100 per cent security. The enemies cannot enter the prayer sites. With such actions they want to show they exist."
The  Shi'ite Muslim festival of Ashura marks the martyrdom of the Prophet  Mohammad's grandson Hussein in the battle of Karbala in Iraq in the year  680.
Ashura is the biggest event  in the Shi'ite Muslim calendar, when large processions are vulnerable to  militant attacks, including suicide bombings. Pakistan has deployed  tens of thousands of paramilitary soldiers and police during Ashura.
Blood has spilled between Pakistan's majority Sunni and minority Shi'ite militants for decades.
Sectarian  strife has intensified since Sunni militants deepened ties with al  Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban insurgents after Pakistan joined the  U.S.-led campaign against militancy after the September 11 attacks.
