  <text>PanARMENIAN.Net -  Syria and the United Nations signed an agreement on Thursday, April 19 on the terms of a ceasefire monitoring mission, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said, according to Reuters.
A statement from UN-Arab League mediator Kofi Annan said the Syrian government and the United Nations had agreed a basis for a "protocol" on the deployment of more observers.
In the first progress report since the Security Council passed a resolution on Saturday authorizing the deployment of observers, Secretary-General Ban proposed an expanded mission of 300 personnel to monitor a shaky ceasefire between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters.
Ban said this week that 250 observers were too few in a country of 23 million where the United Nations says at least 9,000 people have been killed in the past 13 months. He sought European help in supplying planes and helicopters.
But Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said 250 was a "reasonable number", adding they should be from countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa - all more sympathetic to Damascus than are the West or the Arab League.
The Cold War ended and “Russians” came to be replaced by a new enemy - Islamic radicalism and fundamentalism - and it was very serious.
