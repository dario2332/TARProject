  <text>More than 150 heavily-armed Islamist militants stormed the
central prison outside the restive northwestern town of Bannu
bordering the lawless tribal regions where Taliban and Al-Qaeda linked
militants are known to operate.
Ehsanullah Ehsan, spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan
(TTP) militant group claimed responsibility
"We attacked the Bannu prison and got our special members
freed," Ehsan told AFP.
"In a couple of days when all of them have reached their
designated places we will issue details about them. At the moment I cannot give
The attack started at around 1:00am
and continued for two hours, with militants in cars and pick-up trucks shooting
and lobbing grenades to force their way into the prison, a security official
"Some 384 prisoners, including some hardcore militants,
have escaped during the attack," the official said, asking not to be
"Preliminary information suggests that there were some 944
prisoners in the jail according to the tally late Saturday."
Information minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Mian
Iftikhar Hussain, told AFP there were
"at least 20 dangerous prisoners and some militants", among the
"We will investigate why militants were able to carry out
such an attack successfully and what the security was doing," he said.
Hussain said the militants blocked all roads leading to the
prison to delay the arrival of any reinforcements and targeted six barracks
where "dangerous insurgents" were being kept.
Security forces cordoned off the area and arrested some of the escapees,
while others returned voluntarily saying they had fled to avoid the gunfire,
A large number of militants had recently been moved to the jail
from neighbouring Kohat and Lakki Marwat prisons, which are being converted
into centres to rehabilitate former insurgents, the security official said.
A former member of the airforce sentenced to death for an attack
on former president Pervez Musharraf was among the escaped militants, he said.
Adnan Rasheed was convicted after a bomb planted under a bridge
in Rawalpindi near Islamabad
in December 2003 exploded moments after the passing of Musharraf's motorcade.
His appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.
Authorities have shut down the mobile phone network in the area
and army troops along with paramilitary forces and police have launched a
search operation in the area, he said.
Police confirmed the attack but did not give any figures for the
escapees, saying they were still investigating.
Senior Bannu police official Iftikhar Khan told AFP
that at least three police officials were wounded in the attack.
The attackers outnumbered the security forces at the prison and
militants fled before reinforcements reached the jail, he said.
"Some five escapees have handed themselves over to
authorities, while six others were arrested during the search," Khan said.
tribal districts near the Afghan border are rife with homegrown insurgents,
Al-Qaeda operatives and Taliban, who are understood to use rear bases in Pakistan
to plot attacks in neighbouring Afghanistan.
The mountainous region lies outside direct government control
strikes on militant commanders in the region are a key plank in the US
strategy to defeat Al-Qaeda and reverse the insurgency in Afghanistan.
Islamist militants have killed more than 4 900 people
