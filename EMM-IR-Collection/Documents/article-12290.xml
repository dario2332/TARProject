  <text>Her father, Aung San, had become a national hero after he led the country to independence back in 1948.
Hopes for a democratic Myanmar however, were short lived -- a military coup in 1962 plunged the country into authoritarian rule for almost 50 years until the election of a nominally civilian government led by President Thein Sein last year. The president has enacted a series of reforms that few thought were  possible, including the release of hundreds of political  prisoners and the relaxation of media censorship.
In addition, Suu Kyi was elected to parliament in by-elections held last month that international observers determined were free and fair.
The recent signs of democratic progress prompted a visit from British Prime Minister David Cameron who met with President Sein last Friday to discuss the possible suspension of British sanctions on Myanmar. The United States and European Union have also said they will ease some sanctions against Myanmar.
The sanctions by the UK have been in place for the past 23 years - Britain's response to the extensive human rights abuses committed by the Myanmar military regime.
During his visit, Cameron met with Suu Kyi as well -- they both agreed that suspending the sanctions was the right course of action. According to Reuters, Cameron commented that despite making some meaningful steps towards democracy, there is much left for Myanmar to do in way of reform.
"They haven't done enough, there's much more that they need to do, and we will keep that pressure on. That is why suspending sanctions, rather than lifting sanctions, is the right answer," he said. 
It was also during this meeting that Cameron invited Suu Kyi to visit England.
"Two years ago I would have said 'thank you for the invitation, but sorry,'" she said, when asked whether she would accept Cameron's offer.
"Now I'm able to say 'well perhaps', and that's great progress."
