The 12-hour artillery barrage that began on a string of villages northwest of Homs on Friday afternoon also drew a range of international condemnations. Western nations pressed to hold Syria's government accountable to its commitment to the cease-fire, marking a renewed diplomatic push as the violence appeared to spiral again.
Syrian activist groups on Sunday reported government shelling in two towns and fighting with rebel forces in a handful of spots across the country, including a central district in the capital Damascus.
Demonstrators protest Sunday in front of the Syrian consulate in Istanbul against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The flurry of fighting came after rebel fighters vowed to escalate attacks against the regime if the international community didn't intervene in response to the assault on Houla, one of the worst single incidents in Syria's 14-month-long uprising.
Angry calls from protesters, who blame a mission of U.N. monitors in Syria for not standing up to Syrian authorities for their continued attacks on opposition strongholds, raised concerns for the safety of the monitors.
It also cast deeper doubt over the viability of a broader peace plan for Syria backed by the U.N. that the opposition appears no longer willing to entertain amid mounting outrage over the Houla attacks.
The rebel Free Syrian Army said it could no longer commit to the cease-fire. An influential grass-roots group of activists and fighters, the Homs Revolutionary Council, said it wouldn't deal with the U.N. mission  except on humanitarian issues.

Western diplomats said they were concerned that the Syrian government would continue to escalate attacks. But the mission of some 250 unarmed U.N. monitors in Syria is unlikely to change course despite growing questions over its relevance, and new calls for alternative routes of action on Syria.
"It's not like there is a range of options out there or alternatives to cease-fire and peaceful transition," a U.N. official said Sunday. "If or when countries become ready to take alternative action, then I don't think the mission will be an obstacle."
Also on Sunday, U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said he would summon Syria's most senior diplomat in the U.K. over the attack, the Associated Press reported. He said he would ask the head of the Syrian Embassy to meet the Foreign Office's political director Geoffrey Adams on Monday to "make clear our condemnation of the Syrian regime's actions."
In an apparent response to the international outrage, Syria's foreign ministry held a news conference in Damascus on Sunday, acknowledging the Houla attacks as a "massacre" but denying any role in the incident, which the government has blamed on al Qaeda-linked terrorists.
"We categorically deny the responsibility of government forces for the massacre," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihadi Makdissi. A government committee set up to investigate the incident would put out a report in three days, he said.
The U.N. and major Western powers on Saturday all denounced the assault on Houla.
Mr. Hague called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council this week, while his French counterpart called for a meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, a coalition of anti-Assad international powers that excludes Russia and China, the two Security Council veto powers still backing Mr. Assad. The United Arab Emirates called for an emergency meeting of the Arab League.
A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said Sunday: "We are horrified by credible reports of targeting killing, including stabbing and ax attacks on women and children in Houla. These acts serve as a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality."
U.N. monitors at the site of the attack said they saw spent artillery amid rubble in residential neighborhoods and counted 92 bodies, including those of 32 children below the age of 10, confirming accounts by witnesses and opposition activists, who put the death toll from the incident at slightly above 100.
Witnesses and activists said the barrage of tank shelling and rocket fire began Friday afternoon. Security forces had fired at protesters marching out of mosques after the Islamic prayer at noon, leading to fighting between opposition and government forces in which, according to two witness accounts, two army officers and several other soldiers were killed. In apparent retribution, the government started to shell the string of villages in a bombardment that lasted at least 12 hours, these witnesses and other activists said.
Reports of pro-regime groups from neighboring villages raiding homes and stabbing women and children to death in what some activists described as violent sectarian killings remained unclear and unconfirmed Sunday afternoon.
"They want to scare us, and drive us away forever," Mr. Moustapha said by telephone.
Other activists disputed those accounts and cautioned against further inflaming sectarian rage between the largely Sunni opposition and members of the Alawite sect, to which Syria's president and much of the higher ranks of the repressive military and security apparatus belong.
"There are people who are trying to incite sectarian tensions and get the world to react," said Ahmed Qassem, a Houla native living in Saudi Arabia. But he said the artillery attacks, according to his family and friends in the village, were the worst so far on that string of villages.
"There was not a minute between each rocket and shell," he said.
