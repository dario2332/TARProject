  <text>BEIJING &amp;mdash; Bo Xilai, a high-ranking Communist Party official, was stripped of his most powerful posts on Tuesday, and authorities said his wife was being held in connection with the suspected murder of a British businessman, the latest revelations in a political scandal that has rocked China's leadership.

 Mr. Bo, who last month lost his post as party chief of the metropolitan region of Chongqing, was suspended from the Politburo, the 25-member body that runs China, and the larger Central Committee, on suspicion of serious disciplinary infractions, the government announced. The move ended the political career of Mr. Bo, who as recently as February was viewed as a serious contender for one of the top nine posts in the leadership.
China also announced that Mr. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, a lawyer, was strongly suspected, along with a member of their household staff, in causing the November death of Neil Heywood, a British businessman who had close ties to the Bo family. A homicide case against the two of them has been turned over to judicial authorities, the government said.
Mr. Heywood was found dead in a hotel room on Nov. 15 in Chongqinq. Officials there issued a death certificate stating the cause of death was alcohol poisoning, although Mr. Heywood rarely drank. His relatives said he died of a heart attack, and that the body was cremated, at their request, without an autopsy.
 But a re-examination of the evidence now indicates that Mr. Heywood, a high-spirited 41-year old business consultant who professed to love living in China, was the victim of an "intentional homicide," China's official Xinhua news agency said.
The announcement appeared to surprise the British government. An hour later, William Hague, the British foreign minister, told reporters: "It's a death that needs to be investigated, on its own terms and on its own merits, without political considerations. So I hope they will go about it in that way, and I welcome the fact that there will be an investigation."
Xinhua said Ms. Gu and her son, Bo Guagua, had had close relations with Mr. Heywood but later had "a conflict over economic interests." The news agency did not specify how precisely Mr. Heywood died, or what business interests were involved.   Zhang Xiaojun, described as an "orderly" working in Mr. Bo's home, is also suspected of the crime.
China is facing a once-in-a-decade handoff of power to a new generation of leaders this autumn, and the toppling of Mr. Bo has caused a serious disruption at a time when stability is paramount. Mr. Bo, 62. a charismatic and contentious politician who openly aspired to join that new generation, has commanded support among some other descendants of revolutionary figures, certain generals, and those in the Communist Party's left wing unhappy about the government's current direction.
"China is a socialist country ruled by law, and the sanctity and authority of law shall not be trampled," Xinhua said Tuesday, attributing the remarks to unnamed senior officials. "Whoever has broken the law will be handled in accordance with law and will not be tolerated, no matter who is involved."
The murder investigation stems from information provided to the authorities by one of Mr. Bo's closest aides, Wang Lijun, who was the top police official in Chongqing until he sought refuge at the American consulate in Chengdu, about 200 miles away, in early February.
Mr. Wang is himself being investigated for treason for his attempt to seek protection from the United States, according to several sources. But he is being credited with having cooperated with authorities and have brought forward evidence regarding Mr. Heywood's death, according to Chinese sources familiar with the case. 
Months earlier, before Mr. Heywood's death, both Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang already had come under the scrutiny of central disciplinary authorities over corruption and other allegations, they and others with senior party ties said.
During the more than 30 hours he spent at the American consulate, Mr. Wang told American officials  that Ms. Gu had plotted to poison Mr. Heywood, and turned over a police file containing highly technical documents, according to people knowledgeable about the case.
