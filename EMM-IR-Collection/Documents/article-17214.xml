  <text>Two servicemen shot by Afghan police in Helmand named as Corporal Brent John McCarthy and Lance Corporal Lee Thomas Davies
Two British servicemen who were shot dead by members of the Afghan police force in Helmand on Saturday have been named by the Ministry of Defence.
Lance Corporal Lee Thomas Davies, 27, from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was killed alongside Corporal Brent John McCarthy, 25, of the Royal Air Force at a patrol base in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand province.
The servicemen were providing security for a meeting with local officials when two people wearing Afghan police uniforms opened fire.
In a statement released on Monday,the family of Cpl McCarthy said: "Brent was a loving, sensitive young man. He excelled at sport and had the whole world in front of him. He loved his family dearly and will always be a hero to his niece Miajay.
"Brent will be sadly missed, not only by us but also by his loving partner Sarah and her devoted family. Life will never be the same for any of us. We will love you always. God bless."
Cpl McCarthy and L/Cpl Davies were at a meeting as part of a police advisory team at the local Afghan police headquarters near Attal patrol base at the time of the attack. The pair came under small arms fire, during which both were fatally injured.
It is thought two assailants were responsible for the attack.
The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, paid tribute to the British soldiers. He said: "I send out my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of Corporal Brent McCarthy and Lance Corporal Lee Davies, whose lives were cut tragically short by a cowardly act of aggression.
"Both servicemen were performing an invaluable role, training and mentoring Afghan police, helping to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be a place from which international terrorists can launch attacks on our society.
"Their sacrifice will not be in vain and we will never forget them."
Cpl McCarthy was born into a service family in Hannover, Germany, before returning to the Midlands, where he grew up in Telford, Shropshire. He joined the RAF in August 2008 and later joined the RAF police. He was described by family and friends as "a man of many talents and diverse interests", a keen football and hockey player who also played the drums.
Cpl McCarthy was embedded with the Welsh Guards as part of the police mentoring and advisory group .
He leaves behind his father John, mother Sarah, sister Jodie, his partner Sarah, niece Miajay and nephew Kyron.
Lieutenant Colonel Dino Bossi, commanding officer of the police mentoring and advisory group, 1st Battalion  Welsh Guards, said: "His intelligence, ready wit and his desire to muck in and take part in all aspects of communal life meant that he fitted seamlessly into an extremely tight team."
L/Cpl Davies, from Carmarthen, Wales, passed out from Catterick in April 2010 before joining the Welsh Guards. He was described as an "exemplary member of the Welsh Guards" and was "an extremely popular and respected member of his company and platoon".
Lt Col Bossi said: "Lance Corporal Lee Davies loved being a soldier – it was who he was … He swiftly made a name for himself for his enthusiasm, fitness and professionalism as an infantry soldier and in less than two years was promoted to the rank of lance corporal.
"To have made such a profound impact so early in his army career speaks volumes about the quality of the man we have lost today."
He added that he was a "formidably talented team commander" and that the Welsh Guards "have lost a man of inestimable promise".
