(CNN) -- The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Jakob Kellenberger, arrives Monday in Syria for two days of talks with senior Syrian officials that are intended to respond to the humanitarian needs of those Syrians wounded or displaced. He arrives amid ongoing violence which killed at least 47 on Monday alone, according to opposition groups, and continuing international outcry against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
''I am determined to see the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent expand their presence, range and scope of activities to address the needs of vulnerable people," Kellenberger said in a news release about his third such visit since last June. "This will be a key element of my talks with the Syrian officials.''
Kellenberger, who was to meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mu'alem, Minister of the Interior Major-General Mohamad al-Shaar, and Minister of Health Dr Wael al-Halki, will also raise the issue of access to all places of detention. "Visiting people who have been detained remains a priority for us," he said. "I will also further discuss practical measures for implementing our initiative for a daily two-hour cessation of fighting. A daily pause in the hostilities is essential in order to evacuate wounded people and deliver aid if and when the fighting intensifies."
The release said the ICRC has, in recent weeks, obtained greater access to some of the areas affected by the unrest.
At the Vatican in Rome, the Pontifical Council "Cor Unum" announced that Pope Benedict XVI has donated $100,000 to support the Syrians. The money will be used for the charitable activities of the church in Syria "in support of the suffering population," the council said.
On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced an additional $12 million in humanitarian aid -- nearly doubling the amount of American money pledged for humanitarian aid like field hospitals and medical training.
But Syrian National Council member Adib Shishakly said that's not enough to meet the needs of the million-plus people affected by the violence in Syria.
"A million dollars daily, minimum, is needed," Shishakly said.
"If we don't bring protection for the people inside Syria, it's like we didn't do anything," he added, calling for international backing of the rebel Free Syrian Army, safe zones to protect people and relief and medical support.
He said that the opposition could not hold out forever if al-Assad does not make good soon on his promise to accept a peace plan proposed by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
"We cannot keep this thing going," he said. "So if we give a chance to the regime and we don't give a deadline to the Annan mission, then we're giving the Assad regime a chance to commit more killing, more torture."
Annan, the joint UN/Arab League envoy, was to update the U.N. Security Council in a closed session on Monday about the prospects for peace in Syria.
He has proposed a peace plan whose terms include an end to all violence by the government and opposition, the delivery of timely humanitarian aid, the release of arbitrarily detained people, freedom of movement for journalists, respect for peaceful demonstrations and freedom of association.
But prospects for the plan's adoption by the hard-line al-Assad government dimmed Monday, when opposition activists blamed fresh violence for the deaths of at least 47 people.
Four children, a woman and seven soldiers from the rebel Free Syrian Army were among the dead, said the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. At least 12 people were killed in the northern area of Idlib and 30 in Homs, the LCC said.
And the LCC reported Monday that 75 corpses were found in a refrigerator of Homs' National Hospital after Free Syrian Army forces captured it.
The group also said regime troops launched an arrest campaign in Daraa province -- the cradle of the Syrian uprising -- and burned the homes of opposition activists.
The reports came a day after dozens of international leaders bolstered support for a Syrian opposition group that is vowing to pay rebel fighters.
The international Friends of the Syrian People group formally recognized the Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people at a conference in Istanbul on Sunday.
That effectively makes the SNC, which includes many Syrian exiles, the main opposition group with which other nations plan to work.
The 83-member Friends group -- which includes representatives from Turkey, the Arab League, United States, France and the United Kingdom -- declared its "support for legitimate measures taken by the Syrian population to protect themselves" -- but stopped short of agreeing to send weapons to the poorly armed rebels.
The Syrian National Council committed Sunday to paying salaries to rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army, which consists largely of defectors from Syria's military and is now the chief force challenging al-Assad's regime.
One conference participant said the payments could induce more defections from the government military forces and "contribute to the demoralization of the regime."
The Friends group also called for Annan to set a timeline for next steps if the bloodshed continues.
Sunday's formal recognition of the Syrian National Council by the Friends of the Syrian People group came after months of concerns by Syrian observers that the opposition was disjointed and didn't have a valid plan for a possible post-al-Assad era.
On Sunday, Syrian National Council President Burhan Ghalioun told the Friends group that the opposition is committed to an inclusive, democratic government that will not discriminate on religious or ethnic bases and will guarantee civil rights for all if and when it ousts Syria's current government.
But before that happens, he said, the Syrian opposition needs more help from the international community to address ongoing violence that has left thousands dead and to help the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who are struggling as a result.
"You are watching the tragic scenes coming from Syria," Ghalioun said, urging leaders worldwide to help with actions and aid. "The Syrian regime is benefiting from the hesitance of the international community and its division, by tightening up its siege on the cities, displacing its residents and shelling its neighborhoods."
CNN cannot confirm reports from inside Syria because the government severely restricts access by international journalists, but the majority of reports from inside the country suggest the government is pummeling neighborhoods in an attempt to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster.
The Syrian regime has consistently blamed "armed terrorist groups" for the violence. On Monday, it said five "army and law enforcement martyrs" were buried Sunday after being targeted by such groups.
The United Nations estimates at least 1 million Syrians have been affected and more than 9,000 have died since the unrest began, while opposition activists put the death toll at more than 10,000.
