Syrian rebels have killed 23 soldiers, according to a rights group opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, in battles around the town of Rastan.
Syrian rebels have killed 23 soldiers, according to a rights group opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, in battles around the town of Rastan.
The fighting on the outskirts of Rastan followed heavy army shelling of the town in which opposition sources said at least nine people were killed, including a local rebel commander.
Rastan has slipped in and out of government control since the uprising against Assad erupted in March 2011. Reports from Syria cannot be independently verified as state authorities have barred international journalists and rights groups.

Shelling began yesterday and intensified overnight, activists said, a new blow to a ceasefire declared by peace envoy Kofi Annan a month ago and which UN monitoring mission on the ground are observing.
"Shells and rockets have been hitting the town since 3am at a rate of one a minute. Rastan has been destroyed," a member of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA)in Rastan who declined to be named told Reuters by satellite phone.
He said among those killed was Ahmad Ayoub, an FSA commander whose fighters were battling the army forces which he said were made up of elite units and members of Military Intelligence.
The British-based Observatory said fighting began at dawn on Monday and that rebels destroyed three armoured personnel carriers and seized two others, capturing around 15 soldiers.
Rastan has in the past been a major source of Sunni Muslim conscripts who provide most of manpower in the military, which is dominated by Alawite officers.
Sunni officers from Rastan began defecting after security forces shot dead dozens of demonstrators in the town and arrested many of its notables.
The area was scene of the first serious armed confrontations
Its strategic location and the terrain has helped deserters from disparate units mount raids against army buses and roadblocks manned by Military Intelligence and pro-Assad militia, opposition activists said.
Rastan lies about 180km north of Damascus, among farmland and wheat fields on the Orontes River and on the northern highway leading to Aleppo.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday there was only a narrow window of opportunity to avert full-scale civil war in Syria, which sits at a crossroads of Middle East conflict bordering Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Iraq and Lebanon.
Its 23m population comprises a mix of faiths, sects and ethnic groups whose tensions resonate in neighbouring states.
