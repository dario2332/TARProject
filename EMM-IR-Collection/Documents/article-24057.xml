  <text>LBC television station reported on Sunday that most roads in North Lebanon’s city of Halba were closed.
“There is a lot of tension among [Halba] residents who said they will not end their protest until the results of the investigation into the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, [were revealed],” the report added.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Merheb, was also killed.
