  <text>UN and Arab League special envoy on Syria Kofi Annan arrived in Iran on Tuesday for talks centering on the Islamic republic's key regional ally, the official IRNA news agency reported.
He flew in from Turkey after visiting Syrian refugees in camps along the border with its violence-swept southern neighbor. The United Nations says more than 9,000 people have been killed in a year-long crackdown on dissent in Syria.
Annan was met at Tehran airport by an Iranian deputy foreign minister, Hossein Ami Abdollahian. He is to see Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi early on Wednesday.
Iran has repeated that it fully backs President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and has lent it political and material support.
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said late last month that "Iran will defend Syria because of its backing of the anti-Zionist [anti-Israeli] resistance."
Annan, who oversaw a six-point ceasefire plan initially agreed to by the Syrian regime and opposition, told the UN Security Council in a letter on Tuesday that Assad had failed to send the required "signal of peace."
Syrian government forces withdrew from some cities before a deadline on Tuesday, as agreed, but now have new targets, he said.
He said a "fundamental change of course" was needed by Assad to achieve a ceasefire in the next 48 hours.
