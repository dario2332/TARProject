  <text>Annan was in Turkey visiting refugee camps of Syrians who had come over the border after fleeing the violence in Turkey. He said some of the refugee families he met with told stories of being shot at from Syria as they tried to come over the border. Annan also praised Turkey for their good work in taking in and caring for the refugees.
Syria's apparent disregard for the ceasefire has drawn international criticism. British Foreign Secretary William Hague accused Assad's regime of using Tuesday's deadline "as a cover for intensified military efforts to crush Syria's opposition."
A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said Syria's claims of troop withdrawals on Tuesday were "a new expression of this flagrant and unacceptable lie."
Russia has demanded that Syria live up to its promise to fulfil the terms of the plan laid out by Annan. Speaking after his meeting with Muallem, Lavrov also urged global powers to pressure the rebels to renounce violence as well.
"It is clear that success is possible only if other members of the international community that have influence on the [warring] Syrian sides, will also work towards a cease-fire in the country with a similar responsible attitude," he said.
'Too early' to call it failure
Despite the lack of any signs of a ceasefire by Thursday's 6 a.m. deadline as outlined in his plan, Annan did not think all hope for peace was lost.
"I believe it is a bit too early to say that the plan has failed," he said. "The plan is still on the table, and it's a plan we are all fighting to implement."
The UN Security Council will take up the issue of Syria's response to the ceasefire calls.
