  <text>Residents of Al-Qobba neighborhood in North Lebanon’s Tripoli blocked the roads leading to the area’s square using burning tires and steel barriers to protest the killing of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahid, the National News Agency reported on Sunday. The report added that no other roads were blocked in the city.
The NNA reported earlier on Sunday that an “armed convoy” carrying Abdel Wahid to the northern Lebanese town of Halba to participate in a rally refused to stop at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Akkar.
According to the report, the Lebanese army opened fire when the convoy failed to stop, which led to the death of Abdel Wahid and a bodyguard identified as Mohammad Hussein Merheb, both from the town of Al-Beri.
