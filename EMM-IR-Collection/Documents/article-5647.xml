  <text>Syria is claiming that it has already begun troop withdrawals in some of the battle-torn areas of the country, a spokesman for UN envoy Kofi Annan says.
Annan was scheduled to brief the UN general assembly by video link at 10 a.m. Thursday ET on the Syria situation.
Ahmad Fawzi told reporters in Geneva that officials with President Bashar al-Assad's government "have told us they have begun withdrawing troops from certain areas," including Daraa, Idlib and Zabadani.
Fawzi said a Syrian ceasefire is expected to begin no later than 48 hours after April 10. He says "the clock starts on the 10th for both sides to cease all forms of violence." He also said Annan will travel to Tehran on April 11 to talk with officials in Iran, whichis seen as a key ally of the current Syrian regime.
His comments and the description of the timing came even as activists in Syria said government troops were attacking a suburb of the capital in what they described as one of the most violent campaigns since the year-old uprising began.
The offensives appeared to be a push by President Bashar Assad's forces to make gains on the ground ahead of a ceasefire next week.
The latest violence comes despite Assad's agreement to implement the ceasefire starting Tuesday. The truce is the keystone of a plan put forward by Annan, the joint UN-Arab League envoy, aimed at ending the country's year-long crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 9,000 people according to the UN.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops clashed with rebel army defectors in the northern towns of Hraytan and Anadan near Aleppo. The Observatory also reported fighting in the Damascus suburb of Douma and the southern village of Kfar Shams.
Mohammed Abu Nasr, an activist in Hraytan, said the town of about 50,000 has been subjected to intense shelling by tanks and helicopters since 5 a.m. local time. He added that a ground offensive began three hours later and hundreds of troops are pushing their way into the town.
"There are wounded people in the streets that we cannot reach because of the shelling," Abu Nasr said by telephone. "The situation is catastrophic in the city. Large numbers of people are fleeing."
Hraytan is just north of Aleppo that has been relatively quiet since Syria's uprising began in March 2011 when protesters inspired by other Arab Spring revolts took to the streets to call for political reform. The regime has tried to violently quash spreading dissent, and many in the opposition have since taken up arms to protect themselves and attack government troops.
An amateur video posted online by activists showed smoke billowing from several areas in Anadan as the narrator said the shelling was taking place Thursday morning. Another video showed Anadan shortly before sunrise as cracks of heavy gunfire echoed as prayers could be heard blaring from mosques loudspeakers.
Anti-regime activists cited the latest assaults as evidence Assad is trying to crush those seeking to overthrow his regime before the ceasefire goes into effect. Activist groups reported more than 50 dead nationwide on Wednesday.
The opposition suspects Assad agreed to the truce plan just to buy more time to continue his military crackdown on the revolt.
The truce is the keystone of a six-point plan put forward by Annan, the joint UN-Arab League envoy. It requires regime forces to withdraw from towns and cities, followed by a withdrawal by rebel fighters. Then all sides are supposed to hold talks on a political solution.
