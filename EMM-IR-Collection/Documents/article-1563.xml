  <text>A suicide bomber attacked a Shia Muslim shrine in central Kabul today where a crowd of hundreds had gathered for the festival of Ashura, killing up to 48 people including women and children and injuring hundreds more in what appeared to be an unprecedented sectarian attack.
Afghanistan has a history of tension and violence between Sunnis and the Shia minority, but since the fall of the Taliban the country had been spared the large scale sectarian attacks that have troubled neighbouring Pakistan.
The noon bomb in a riverside shrine, in the heart of old Kabul, appears to set a grim new precedent.
Shortly after, a bicycle bomb exploded near the main mosque in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, killing four people and injuring 17 others.
The city's streets were filled with people celebrating Ashura, but it was not immediately clear if that attack was also targeting Shia worshippers.
Taliban spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment on either attack.
The Shia Muslim festival of Ashura marks the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Hussein in the battle of Karbala in Iraq in the year 680.
Ashura is the biggest event in the Shia Muslim calendar, when large processions are vulnerable to militant attacks, including suicide bombings. Pakistan has deployed tens of thousands of paramilitary soldiers and police during Ashura.
Sectarian strife has intensified since Sunni militants deepened ties with al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban insurgents after Pakistan joined the US-led campaign against militancy after the September 11 attacks.
