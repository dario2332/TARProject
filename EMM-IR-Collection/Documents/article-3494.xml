  <text>Foreign correspondent Marie Colvin has been killed in Syria
Sunday Times war reporter Marie Colvin has been killed in a targeted shelling attack by government forces in the war-torn city of Homs.
The news comes just hours after the American-born foreign correspondent reported on 'sickening' scenes in the Syrian city.
French photographer Remi Ochlik, 28, also died in the attack on a makeshift media centre set up by anti-regime activists in the Baba Amr district.
Last night Colvin, who 
is in her fifties, appeared on Channel 4 and ITN's News at Ten reporting
on the bombardment of the opposition stronghold.
Reports say they were escaping from the building when they were hit by a rocket.
Much of the building is said to have collapsed, opposition supporters said.
Abu Bakr, who witnessed the attack in Homs, said: 'I left the house after it got struck and headed to a house across the street.
'The shelling continues and the bodies of the journalists are still on the ground.
'We can't get them out because of the intensity of the shelling even though we're only a few metres away from them.'
Foreign Secretary William Hague paid tribute to the journalist, saying: 'Marie Colvin died helping the people of Syria share their plight with the world.'
Novelist Salman Rushdie tweeted: 'Marie Colvin killed in Homs. Dreadful news. A great reporter, fine writer and fearless woman is gone. Her many friends are devastated.'
Up to 45 people were killed this morning by the Syrian army in attacks on Baba Amr.
Intense shelling by Syrian troops with tanks and artilleries began at 6.30am and was continuing hours later, it was reported. An eyewitness said the apartment used by journalists was hit around 10am.
It has been reported that house that they were based in was a well-known temporary press centre in Homs which sat next door to a hospital.
Homs has been under siege from President Bashar al-Assad's forces since February 4.
The Syrian military has redoubled its 
attacks on Homs in the past few days, aiming to retake neighborhoods 
that have come under control of the opposition and armed rebels - many 
of them military defectors.
The seizure of territory and nearly daily 
clashes between the rebels and regime forces have pushed Syria to the 
brink of all-out civil war.
France's Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, said the attacks show the 'increasingly intolerable repression' by Syrian forces.

With so few buildings in Homs having 
basements, residents and correspondents have been seeking shelter in the
stairwells during the relentless bombardments.
