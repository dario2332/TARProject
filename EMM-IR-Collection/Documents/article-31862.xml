  <text>The UN Security Council on Sunday condemned "in the strongest possible terms" the Syrian government for the Houla massacre in which at least 108 people were killed.
A statement agreed by the 15-nation council, including Syrian ally Russia, said the attacks "involved a series of government artillery and tank shelling on a residential neighborhood" and again demanded that President Bashar al-Assad withdraw heavy weapons from Syrian towns.
"The members of the Security Council reiterated that all violence in all its forms by all parties must cease. Those responsible for acts of violence must be held accountable," said the statement.
UN observers in Syria saw at least 108 bodies in Houla including 49 children and at least seven women, UN officials said.
Britain's UN Ambassador Mark Lyall-Grant said that the council statement, while important, was not enough.
"Over the next two days, the Security Council will be meeting again to discuss in more detail what steps need to be taken," Lyall Grant told reporters.
UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan is to brief the Security Council on the Syria crisis at a new meeting on Wednesday.
