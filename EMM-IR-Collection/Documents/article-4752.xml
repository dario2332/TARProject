  <text>BEIRUT, April 3, (Agencies): A Syrian government official says troops have begun withdrawing from some cities and are returning to their bases.
The official told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the withdrawal was mainly from calm cities while in tense areas, regime forces are redeploying and taking positions on the outskirts.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, spoke days after Damascus accepted an April 10 deadline to carry out international envoy Kofi Annan’s cease-fire plan. It requires regime forces to withdraw from towns and cities and observe a cease-fire. Rebel fighters are to immediately follow by ceasing violence.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry says Syria’s government has informed Moscow that it has started implementing UN envoy Kofi Annan’s plan aimed at ending its yearlong conflict.
The ministry said in a statement that the Syrian ambassador to Moscow told Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov on Tuesday that Damascus had begun fulfiilling its obligations under the plan.
The plan calls on Bashar Assad’s government to pull out its forces from Syrian towns and cities by April 10. The terse statement didn’t say which, if any, troops had been withdrawn or provide any other details.
It said Bogdanov expressed Russia’s satisfaction with the Syrian government’s decision. The ministry noted the need for the Syrian opposition to follow suit.
Opposition activists accused Syrian troops of shelling two cities on Tuesday in a campaign to weaken forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad’s government before a ceasefire deadline next week.
Rebel fighters also kept up their attacks, killing three soldiers in separate actions in northern Syria, activists said.
Assad has agreed to a ceasefire negotiated by international peace envoy Kofi Annan from April 10, the latest effort to end a year of bloodshed stemming from an uprising against his rule.
An advance team from the United Nations’ peacekeeping department will arrive in Damascus in the next two days to work out how observers can monitor the truce, Annan’s spokesman said in Geneva.
But Syrian opposition figures as well as Western governments have already made it clear they are not convinced that Assad, who has failed to honour previous commitments, would keep his word this time.
“He is a liar,” said Waleed al-Fares, an opposition activist in Homs, a city which came to symbolise the anti-Assad struggle as opposition-held areas endured weeks of bombardments and sniper fire.
Fares said Assad was playing for time to gain the upper hand over poorly-armed rebel forces which have been driven from city strongholds in the past two months.
Targets in Homs were coming under shelling on Tuesday, he said. Another opposition activist, Mortadha al-Rashid, told Reuters from Damascus that the western border town of Zabadani was also taking a pounding.
“The regime shows no signs of stopping. There are people being shelled in Zabadani right now,” Rashid said. “Where are Kofi Annan’s words? Because we have never seen them on the streets.”
In violence elsewhere, rebel fighters killed one soldier in a clash in northern Idlib province, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitor which collates reports from inside Syria.
Armed men also attacked the home of a military director of logistics in Aleppo, killing two guards, the Observatory said.
The Syrian state news agency SANA said 10 soldiers and policemen were buried with honours on Monday.
Accounts of the violence can be difficult to verify because the Syrian government restricts access to Western journalists.
But the United Nations estimates Assad’s forces have killed more than 9,000 people in the past year, while the government says about 3,000 security personnel have been killed by what it describes as foreign-backed gangs of terrorists.
SANA said Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem met the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Jakob Kellenberger, and agreed on “a cooperation mechanism” for humanitarian assistance.
It made no mention of the ICRC’s call for a daily two-hour ceasefire to provide aid and evacuate the wounded.
The ICRC pressed Syria Tuesday to give aid workers access to civilians endangered by shelling and armed clashes while fresh violence raised doubts that President Bashar Assad’s regime will adhere to a UN peace plan.
Syria has accepted an April 10 deadline to comply with the conditions laid out by international envoy Kofi Annan, which include withdrawing government forces from populated areas and observing a cease-fire — first by the regime, then by the rebels — and talks by all sides on a political solution.
The plan also calls for an immediate daily two-hour halt to fighting so humanitarian aid can reach suffering civilians, as well as unhindered access for aid groups and journalists.
Opposition activists have blasted the plan as too little, too late and for not stipulating that Assad must leave power. They also accuse him of stalling so he can continue his crackdown on dissent.
A European Union delegation visiting Damascus on Tuesday denounced the ongoing detention without charge of human rights campaigner Mazen Darwish, and expressed concerns for his health.
“The EU delegation condemns the continued detention of Mazen Darwish, president of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression, along with seven other human rights defenders,” it said in a statement.
“The EU delegation is gravely concerned for the safety of those arrested, in particular at reports of the deteriorating health and condition of Darwish.”
It said the detainees had not been charged with any official offence or brought to court, and called on the Syrian authorities to “release the eight human rights defenders as a matter of urgency.”
Winner of the 2011 Roland Berger Human Dignity Prize, Darwish was arrested on Feb 16 along with 13 other activists who were with him at his office in Damascus.
Four days later, seven of the activists were released.
A human rights watchdog warned on Tuesday that Bahraini activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who was on the 55th day of a hunger strike, could die in jail.
“It is impossible to imagine that the Bahrain Grand Prix will go ahead if Abdulhadi al-Khawaja dies on hunger strike in prison,” said Mary Lawlor of Front Line Defenders.
“The Bahraini authorities clearly want to present an image of business as usual but their seeming indifference to the plight of Abdulhadi, who has reached his 55th day without food, risks tragic consequences,” she added in a statement.
A team of Front Line Defenders on Tuesday wound up a three-day visit to Bahrain.
But they were unable to meet Khawaja, who was condemned with opposition activists to life in jail over an alleged plot to topple the Sunni monarchy during a month-long protest that was brutally crushed in mid-March 2011.
He began his hunger strike on the night of Feb 8-9.
“I was able to speak briefly with him on the phone and ask him to take some food,” said Lawlor, adding that “he insisted that he would continue with his hunger strike until freedom or death.”
“Unfortunately, I know just how determined he is,” she said.
Khadija al-Moussawi, his wife, said Monday on her Twitter page that he husband told her over the phone that he decided to refuse taking glucose “because the situation has gone worse in our beloved homeland.”
She said on Tuesday that he has two doctors watching over him and has been transferred to Al-Qalaa prison because the medical centre at Jaw prison was not equipped to handle a feared collapse.
Meanwhile, Bahrain’s culture minister is facing demands for her dismissal after calling conservative lawmakers “not real men” for opposing an annual arts festival under way in Manana.
Sheika Mai bin Mohammad Al Khalifa issued the barb during a stormy parliament session Tuesday over the cultural events. Hard-liners say the event should be canceled in solidarity with the uprising against Syria’s regime.
Sheika Mai called her critics “not real men” for allegedly sending children and others to try to disrupt the festival. Some lawmakers threatened to boycott parliament until she is ousted.
Bahrain’s Sunni monarchy backs cultural and sporting events in attempts to show stability, despite a nearly 14-month-long uprising by the kingdom’s Shiite majority.
Clashes in western Libya have left at least 14 people killed and 80 others wounded in 24 hours, the ruling National Transitional Council said on Tuesday.
“Four people were killed and 35 others were wounded in Zuwarah,” 100 kms (60 miles) west of Tripoli, near the border with Tunisia, the interim authorities said in a statement published online.
Jawher Belhir, a doctor in Zuwarah, gave a higher toll, saying five people were killed and 42 wounded in the western town.
The NTC also said that “10 people were killed and 45 others were hurt in the (nearby towns) of Regdalin and Jamil.”
It said clashes were ongoing and that a delegation had been sent to the region in a bid to “calm the situation and solve the problem.”
Fierce fighting erupted when former rebels from Zuwarah were detained as they passed the town of Jamil. The interim authorities said they intervened to obtain their release and negotiated an agreement.
But after the men were released, armed men from Zuwarah launched an attack.
Since the collapse of slain leader Muammar Gaddafi’s regime last October, tensions have festered in and around Zuwarah, where residents belong to the Amazigh minority.
Residents of Jamil and Regdalin are accused by former rebels of standing by the regime of Gaddafi during the 2011 conflict.
Earlier, Othman Ben Sassi, a member of NTC told AFP that the situation in his native town of Zuwarah was pitiful.
All Libyan airlines and Venezuelan carrier Conviasa were banned from flying into the 27-nation European Union on Tuesday due to safety concerns.
The Venezuelan company was added to a blacklist of airlines with poor safety records while Libya decided, in consultation with EU officials, to bar its airlines from flying to the EU until at least Nov 22.
Conviasa was banned “due to numerous safety concerns arising from accidents and the results of ramp checks at EU airports,” the European Commission said in a statement.
The EU also reviewed the safety record of two other Venezuelan carriers, Estellar Latinoamerica and Aerotuy, but decided to place them under increased monitoring instead of imposing restrictions.
The safety oversight of airlines licenced in Libya posed “serious concerns” but the EU decided not to place them on the blacklist since the Libyan civil aviation authorities adopted restrictions on their own.
“Nonetheless, implementation of the measures decided by the Libyan authorities remains subject to close monitoring,” the EU’s executive arm said.
The latest European air safety list includes 279 air carriers from 21 countries, ranging from Afghanistan to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, the Philippines and Zambia.
