Authorities say members of the Florida A&amp;;M university big band mercilessly pummelled Robert Champion, 26, five months ago, following a performance against a rival school.
He died aboard a chartered bus parked outside an Orlando hotel.
While the most sensational hazing cases have typically involved fraternities, sororities or athletic teams, the FAMU tragedy in November exposed a brutal tradition among marching bands at some colleges around the US.
Eleven defendants were charged with hazing resulting in death, a felony, and misdemeanor offences that could bring nearly six years in prison. Two others face misdemeanor charges.
It was not immediately clear whether those charged were all students or whether they included faculty members or others involved in the road trip.
Champion had bruises on his chest, arms, shoulder and back and died of internal bleeding, state attorney Lawson Lamar said.
Witnesses told emergency dispatchers that the drum major was vomiting before he was found unresponsive aboard the bus.
The prosecutor gave no motive for the beating. But witnesses said Champion might have been targeted because he opposed the routine hazing that went on in the marching band or because he was gay, according his family's attorney.
Hazing has long been practiced in marching bands, particularly at historically black colleges like FAMU in the South, where the band is often as revered as the football team and members are campus celebrities.
Champion's parents have sued the bus company owner, claiming the driver stood guard outside while the hazing took place. The company said the driver was helping band members with their equipment.
The lawsuit described two types of hazing that took place on the bus.
In one ritual, students ran from the front of the bus to the back while other band members slapped, kicked and hit them. A student who fell was stomped and dragged to the front to run again.
In a ritual known as "the hot seat," a pillowcase was placed over the student's nose and mouth and he or she was forced to answer questions.
If the student gave the correct answer, the pillowcase was removed briefly; a student who supplied a wrong answer was given another question without a chance to take a breath, the lawsuit said.
State attorney Lawson Lamar said prosecutors didn't have the evidence to bring manslaughter or second-degree murder charges.
"The testimony obtained to date does not support a charge of murder, in that it does not contain the elements of murder," he said.
"We can prove participation in hazing and a death. We do not have a blow or a shot or a knife thrust that killed MrChampion."
Hazing in Florida was upgraded to a felony in 2005 following the death of a University of Miami student four years earlier.
Chad Meredith was drunk and died trying to swim across a lake at the behest of his fraternity brothers.
No charges were filed, but a civil jury ordered the fraternity to pay Meredith's parents $12 million.
Champion's death has jeopardised the future of FAMU's legendary marching band, which has performed at the Grammys, presidential inaugurations and Super Bowls and represented the US in Paris at the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
