  <text>MOSCOW - Syria's foreign minister told Moscow Tuesday Damascus had started withdrawing troops in line with Kofi Annan's peace plan but Russia said the regime should implement the initiative more decisively.
The rare visit by the veteran Foreign Minister Walid Muallem to Moscow coincided with a deadline under the Annan plan for Syria to withdraw forces from protest cities amid Western worries the scheme is in tatters.
"I told my Russian colleague of the steps Syria is taking to show its goodwill for the implementation of the Annan plan," Muallem said after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
"We have already withdrawn military units from different Syrian provinces," he said without giving details on locations.
Muallem also said Syria had freed some prisoners who had been arrested for participating in anti-government riots.
He added that a ceasefire should begin "simultaneously" with the arrival of international observers, in another apparent diversion from the Annan peace plan championed by the West.
Lavrov complained that Syria should be more decisive in fulfilling the plan of UN-Arab League envoy Annan, which most notably calls on Syria to pull out government forces and weaponry from cities hit by protests.
"We believe their actions could have been more active, more decisive when it comes to the implementation of the plan," Lavrov said at a joint news conference with Muallem.
He added however that Muallem had informed him that Damascus was starting to implement the key conditions of the plan concerning the withdrawal of weaponry and troops.
Damascus had already made clear it could only stick to the Annan plan if it received written guarantees from the rebels.
Lavrov said Annan would act as a mediator between Damascus and the rebels, adding that he would speak to him by phone later in the day.
"I've heard (from Muallem) about a desire to receive a letter from Kofi Annan which would state how the opposition reacts to the relevant part of the six-point plan," Lavrov said in response to a question about guarantees.
With tensions riding high between Damascus and Ankara after Syrian forces fired shots into a refugee camp across the Turkish border, Muallem accused Turkey of undermining the Annan plan by helping the rebels.
"Turkey hosts Syrian armed groups, has built training camps for them, lets them illegally cross into Syria and smuggle arms (to Syria) across its territory," Muallem said.
The White House had earlier said there was "no sign" that the government of President Bashar al-Assad was sticking by the Annan peace plan after signing on to the deal last week.
"An immediate cessation of fire is the number one task," said Lavrov. "We urgently call on our Syrian colleagues to strictly implement all their obligations in accordance with the Kofi Annan plan," Lavrov said.
Russia has repeatedly condemned the West for taking what it says is a one-sided approach in the conflict but has in recent weeks shown signs of growing exasperation with the intransigence of the Assad regime.
Assad's secular regime has been able until now to count on Moscow as a friend, in a long standing alliance that goes back to warm relations between the Soviet Union and his predecessor and father Hafez al-Assad.
Moscow says its position is objective and gives it unmatched influence over Damascus, although rights activists have accused Russia of giving a green light to violence that has left more than 9,000 dead according to the UN.
"We consistently work towards this goal (democracy in Syria) with the Syrian government without any sort of hidden agenda, wishing the peace and flourishing of the Syrian nation," said Lavrov.
"The most urgent task right now is not to allow new casualties from any sides," he added.
