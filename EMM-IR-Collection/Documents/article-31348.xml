  <text>PHOTOS: Escape from Syria
The U.N. has verified that 92 people were killed within hours in the Syrian district of Houla, including at least 32 children, their mangled corpses laid out on a plastic mat, set apart from dozens of adult victims. Some of the children were in blood-soaked pajamas; others had their skulls ripped open. They were killed by artillery and tank shells, the UN said; Syrian activists claim that others were butchered with knives. The Syrian opposition blamed President Bashar Assad's regime. The government blamed "Al-Qaeda-linked terrorist groups."

Activists say they relayed urgent pleas from the residents of Houla for help from about midday Friday, when the assault on their district began. Some of the activists say they asked UN observers to travel to the area, in the hope that their presence would be enough to protect its residents. The blue berets traveled the following day, on Saturday, in time to count the bodies.
The Syrian government denied responsibility for the slaughter. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told a press conference in Damascus on Sunday that the regime's tanks were not in Houla and its heavy weapons were not aimed at the region's residents. Instead, he said that heavily armed "terrorists," complete with mortars and anti-tank missiles, committed the atrocity. Syria has been subjected to "a tsunami of lies" he said. "We have set up a military and legal committee to investigate," he added, saying "results will emerge within days."
International condemnation has been much swifter. "This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms," Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and the Joint Special Envoy for Syria, Kofi Annan said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the "atrocity." There were calls for a flurry of meetings, including an urgent session of the UN Security Council, and another Friends of Syria conference, a group of  Assad's Arab and Western opponents. Previous Security Council attempts to censure Assad's regime have been shot down by Russian and Chinese vetoes, and earlier Friends of Syria meetings have pledged various forms of support that many activists say have yet to materialize.

The fact is, despite restrictions on media and aid organizations operating in Syria, the world knows what is happening there, it just doesn't know what to do about it. Will the Houla killings change anything, or will they be just another bloody footnote in a conflict that has killed an unknown number of people? The U.N. stopped counting Syria's dead months ago. NATO has repeatedly said it has no plans to intervene in the conflict. The U.N. secretary general has admitted that "at this time, we don't have any Plan B" for Syria. It's hardly reassuring given that Plan A, the six-point Annan initiative, is barely viable.
The pockmarked cease-fire was the centerpiece of that plan, agreed to by both sides, which also calls for the release of political prisoners, the provision of humanitarian aid via a "daily two-hour humanitarian pause," the right to demonstrate peacefully, freedom of movement for the press and the start of a Syrian-led political process to resolve the crisis. There are no alternatives being offered by anyone for this set-up, "the only game in town," as it has often been described.

Both regime and opposition have now made it clear that they are in an all-or-nothing battle. Pro- and anti-Assad views have increasingly hardened, the gulf between them widening as the tallies of dead, missing and detained have grown. There is little room left for a compromise solution. When the Syrian uprising kicked off last year, there were no calls for foreign intervention, no demands for the execution of the president. There were also no car bombs blowing up in Syrian cities. The situation has become more desperate, and more sectarian. The rebel Free Syrian Army, that ragtag band of under-gunned and overwhelmed defectors and armed civilians, has said that in the wake of the Houla massacre it will no longer abide by Annan's ceasefire (not that it has kept to it, in the first place).
