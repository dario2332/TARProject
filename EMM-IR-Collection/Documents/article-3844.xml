"Ultimatums and artificial deadlines rarely help matters," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said while on a visit to Armenia.
Lavrov added that only the United Nations Security Council - on which Russia wields veto power - could put any time restrictions on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's compliance with Annan's peace plan.
"Annan has a Security Council mandate and it is up to the UN Security Council to decide who is complying with this plan and how," he said.
At the "Friends of Syria" meeting in Istanbul over the weekend Western and Arab nations agreed to ask the UN to set a deadline for Assad to comply with Annan's Syria peace plan.
The plan includes demands for ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of tanks and artillery from residential areas and access for humanitarian aid. Currently the plan doesn't include a time frame by which Assad must comply.

UN Security Council members China and Russia, as well as Syria's ally Iran, did not attend the meeting.
The Russian foreign minister said he did not attend the summit because representatives from Assad's government were not invited.
"We intend to be friends with both sides in Syria," Lavrov said.
Annan, who met Assad in Damascus on March 10, told the UN Security Council in New York on Monday that there has been no progress implementing a Syria ceasefire.
He asked the Council to back an April 10 deadline for partial implementation of his Syria peace plan.
The UN estimates Syrian security forces have killed more than 9,000 people during the last 12 months, and rebels have killed 3,000 troops and police.
Syrian security forces bombarded opposition targets in Homs, Aleppo and villages in the northern Idlib province on Monday despite talks of peace.
"Today doesn't feel much different than yesterday or the day before, or the day before that," opposition activist Waleed Fares said from inside Homs. "Shelling and killing."
