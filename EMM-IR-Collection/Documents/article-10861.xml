  <text>Norwegian man who confessed to killing 77 people in a bomb-and-shooting massacre goes on trial in Oslo
The rightwing fanatic who confessed to killing 77 people in a bomb-and-shooting massacre has gone on trial in Norway's capital but has rejected the authority of the court.
Anders Behring Breivik, dressed in a dark suit, smiled as a guard removed his handcuffs in the crowded courtroom. The 33-year-old then flashed a closed-fist salute, before shaking hands with prosecutors and court officials.
"I don't recognise Norwegian courts because you get your mandate from the Norwegian political parties who support multiculturalism," Breivik said in his first comments to the court.
Breivik also said he didn't recognise the authority of Judge Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen, because he said she was friends with the sister of former Norwegian prime minister and Labour party leader, Gro Harlem Brundtland.
The anti-Muslim militant described himself as a writer, currently working from prison, when asked by the judge for his employment status.
After opening statements on Monday, Breivik is expected to testify for five days, explaining why he set off a bomb in central Oslo, killing eight, and then shot to death 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labour party youth camp on Utøya island, outside the Norwegian capital.
Breivik has admitted to the attacks, claiming they were necessary to protect Norway from being taken over by Muslims, but has rejected criminal guilt. He is facing terrorism and charges of premeditated murder.
The key issue to be resolved during the 10-week trial is the state of Breivik's mental health, which will decide whether he is sent to prison or to psychiatric care.
