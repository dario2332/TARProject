  <text>Quake of magnitude 5.9 brought down buildings and was widely felt in cities including Bologna and Modena, reports say
At least three people have died in a strong earthquake that rocked northern Italy on Sunday morning.
The quake struck at 4am local time (2am GMT) and had a magnitude of 5.9. It was centred in the plains near Modena and felt throughout nearby regions.
One person working a night shift died in the collapse of a factory and two others were killed in another building. Rescue officials were checking reports that other people were buried under rubble.
Thousands of people rushed into the streets after the quake, felt in the major towns of Bologna, Modena, Ferrara, Rovigo, Verona and Mantua.
There has been serious damage to historic buildings and rural structures. Parts of a historic fortress in one town collapsed and rural factories fell down.
A series of strong aftershocks hit the area and local mayors ordered residents to stay out of their homes. The quake was centered 22 miles (35km) north-north-west of Bologna at a relatively shallow depth of 6.3 miles (10km), the US Geological Survey said. Italy's last major earthquake killed nearly 300 people in the central Italian city of L'Aquila in 2009 and had a magnitude of 6.3.
