  <text>An Israeli airstrike on a car near a crowded park in downtown Gaza City killed two militants on Thursday, the second missile strike this week after a period of relative calm along the Israel-Gaza border.
Similar flare-ups have in the past escalated into a wider confrontations between Israel and Hamas-ruled Gaza. After Thursday's strike, Israel's military alleged the two men in the car had planned to infiltrate Israel to attack soldiers and civilians, but provided no details.
It said one of the militants had been involved in a suicide bombing in Israel five years ago that killed three Israeli civilians. Hamas identified the second man as the nephew of the first and a member of the group's military wing.
The car was near a crowded park in downtown Gaza when it was struck. The missile set off an explosion that turned the car into a ball of fire. Onlookers arriving moments later saw the body of a man sprawled near the vehicle with much of his head missing. A dismembered leg and hand of a second person lay on the ground nearby.
Five bystanders were also wounded in the blast, said Adham Abu Salima, an official in the Gaza Health Ministry.
One Gaza militant group, the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, threatened "tough and painful revenge" for the killing of a senior member.
Ihab Ghussein, spokesman for the Gaza Interior Ministry, said the airstrike was "an unjustified crime committed in a populated area and is part of a recent escalation against the Gaza Strip."
Israel repeatedly has targeted suspected militants in missile strikes, including an attack early Wednesday that killed one and wounded two.
In another source of friction, Jerusalem municipal officials announced they would shut down a walkway to a contested shrine at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a move liable to touch off a new round of violence between Muslims and Jews in the volatile holy city.
Any work in the area around the Old City compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary draws fierce condemnation and sometimes violence from Palestinians, many of whom suspect Israel wants to harm Muslim shrines. An official with the Muslim clerical body that runs the complex warned that protests were liable to break out this time, too.
The municipality says the wooden walkway leading to one of the hilltop site's gates — built as a temporary structure after a centuries-old ramp was damaged in a 2004 snowstorm — is a fire hazard and structurally unsound and must be replaced.
In a letter released Thursday, Jerusalem city engineer Shlomo Eshkol informed authorities of his plan to block access to the walkway to all but security forces. The shutdown could take place immediately after a one-week public comment period.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu halted a plan to demolish the walkway last month, fearing a Muslim backlash at a time when pre-election violence was roiling neighboring Egypt. A spokesman for Netanyahu was not available Thursday for comment on the Jerusalem municipality's decision.
The walkway is not the only access to the contested complex, which Israel captured from Jordan along with the rest of east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. But the compound's centrality to both Islam and Judaism makes it one of the most combustible sites in the world. Clashes there in the past have ignited broader violence.
