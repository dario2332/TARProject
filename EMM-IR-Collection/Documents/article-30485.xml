  <text>Many children among dead as town of Houla in Homs province is attacked by Syrian forces, according to activists
At least 90 people, including many children, have been killed after Syrian forces shelled and attacked the town of Houla in Homs province, according to anti-government activists.
The death toll reported on Friday was one of the highest in one area of the country since an internationally brokered ceasefire came into effect last month.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the violence began when security forces opened fire on an opposition protest in Houla. Anti-government forces retaliated and the army began shelling the area, killing an estimated 90 people.
A spokesman for the United Nations' envoy to Syria told the Associated Press in an email on Saturday that international monitors were travelling to Houla "as we speak" to investigate.
The surge in violence came as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general told the UN security council there had been some progress in reducing violence, but the overall situation remained very serious.
"There is a continuing crisis on the ground, characterised by regular violence, deteriorating humanitarian conditions, human rights violations and continued political confrontation," he reported to the security council in a letter.
Reports from activists and the government suggest that violence took places in dozens of areas involving helicopter gunships, tanks, artillery, roadside bombs and small arms.
Activist Ahmad Kassem told Reuters: "The soldiers are shelling Houla right now, the casualties are huge."
In his report to the security council, Ban wrote that the size and sophistication of some recent bomb attacks in Syria suggest that "established terrorist groups" may have been behind them and urged groups and countries not to supply weapons to either side in Syria.
Ban said the UN observers noted that "significant parts of some cities appear to be under the de facto control of opposition elements".
"There is an overall atmosphere of tension, mistrust and fear," Ban said. "The overall level of violence in the country remains quite high."
In other areas of Syria, activists said that a further 33 people were killed. The Syrian government news agency said that 17 people had been killed by anti-government gunmen. None of the figures could be independently verified.
