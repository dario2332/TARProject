  <text>One Goh, 43, allegedly opened fire at Oikos University, a small Christian college in Oakland, killing seven people and injuring three others.
Mr Goh, a former nursing student at the institution, did not enter a plea.
The shootings were the deadliest attack on a US campus since a gunman killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007.
Mr Goh was arrested at a supermarket in the nearby city of Alameda, about an hour after the mid-morning shootings.
According to court documents, he has admitted to police bringing a .45-calibre handgun and four magazines of ammunition to the university.
I think he was looking for me - I have that weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do with it"
Police say he acknowledged shooting people and fleeing the scene.
Officials have said Mr Goh was expelled from the college for "anger management" issues.
But one administrator told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Goh had dropped out, and had repeatedly asked for a tuition refund.
Ellen Cervellon said that Mr Goh had told her that other students had teased him at the school.
"In talking to several of the students and faculty who were there, I think he was looking for me," Ms Cervellon told the Associated Press.
Mr Goh previously lived in Virginia, and records show he had tens of thousands of dollars in debts.
