  <text>(CNN) -- Syrian opposition activists begged for international help Saturday after they said regime forces devastated a town and killed 88 people, mostly children, in a single day.
"This barbaric act was preceded by the regime's mortar shelling," which left entire families dead in the town of Houla, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists.
The group said Saturday that more bodies were found near the reported massacre site.
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a sobering report on the Syrian crisis, detailing "continuing reports of a stepped-up security crackdown by the authorities that has led to massive violations of humans rights ... including arbitrary arrests, torture, enforced disappearance and summary execution of activists, opponents and defectors."
In addition to the massacre in Houla, 43 people were killed elsewhere in Syria on Friday -- bringing the single-day death toll to at least 131, the LCC said.
And early Saturday, at least six people were killed in Idilb province, Homs province and the Damascus countryside, the LCC said.
A caller to Syrian state television blamed the Houla massacre on criminal gangs and terrorist groups. An analyst on the station said al Qaeda and its branches are to blame and that "the Syrian military is the defender of the nation."
The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency made no mention of Houla but said 16 civilians were killed by "terrorists" on Friday across the country.
"We in the Local Coordination Committees are pained by the international community's apparent blindness to the bloodshed, and believe the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) bears the responsibility for its inability to protect Syrian civilians," the group said.
Months of U.N. Security Council attempts to resolve the Syrian crisis have so far failed to stop the bloodshed. Council members Russia and China have vetoed efforts to formally condemn President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
An unspecified number of U.N. monitors visited Houla on Saturday, according to the opposition Homs Coordination Committee, part of the LCC network.
Ban said Friday the full cadre of 300 U.N. observers authorized by the Council will be in Syria in the coming days.
Ban said Friday he is deeply concerned that the violence in Syria has not stopped despite the presence of the monitors and the agreement by both sides to a peace plan.
Some of the violence has stopped when the monitors are around, he said, but across the country the level of it is high.
Ban described deteriorating humanitarian conditions and continued political confrontation in a letter addressed to the head of the U.N. Security Council and obtained by CNN.
The monitors have seen "considerable" physical destruction across Syria, Ban said. They have also seen continued Syrian Army troop concentrations and heavy weapons in population centers, in direct violation of the peace plan forged by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in March.
Both sides blame the other for the destruction the monitors have seen, Ban said.
Some cities appear to be under opposition control, but Ban said residents are often too scared of reprisal to talk to the monitors, or they threaten the U.N. staff out of frustration with the ongoing crisis.
Ban said another key part of Annan's plan calling for the government to speed up the release of arbitrarily detained people hasn't happened. He said it was "unacceptable" that U.N. staff are unable to investigate numerous reports of detained or missing people.
Neither the government nor the opposition are granting total freedom of movement for journalists, and the regime is not allowing people to demonstrate peacefully, Ban said. Both are required under the peace plan.
As reports of deaths mount every day, so do the frustration and anger.
"It's unbelievable that we have 7 billion people on this planet, and they all can't do anything about what they are seeing on TV," activist Abu Emad told CNN from Homs early Saturday.
"Do something," he begged the international community.
Graphic video posted on YouTube purportedly shows the lifeless bodies of several small children killed in Houla. They are spread on the floor amid blankets, caked in blood. One child is turned to reveal a head wound.
"Look, these are just children. It is a massacre!" a man shouts.
CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video.
Government forces also shelled opposition sites in the Homs neighborhoods of Sultanieh and Jobar as people gathered for Friday protests, opposition activists said.
CNN cannot independently confirm reports from within Syria because the government strictly limits access by foreign journalists.
U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, mostly civilians, have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people.
Since al-Assad's government and opposition forces accepted Annan's peace plan in March, at least 1,635 people have been killed, the LCC said Saturday.
Following the reported massacre in Houla on Friday, the rebel Free Syrian Army implored members of the international "Friends of Syria" group to form a military coalition to launch airstrikes against al-Assad forces.
"The situation is becoming unbearable and cannot be dealt with (by) truces or conferences," the FSA said. "The Syrian people are being slaughtered every day."
