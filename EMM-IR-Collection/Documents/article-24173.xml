  <text>An unidentified man dropped two bombs in Tripoli’s Abu Ali River “causing tension” in the city, the National News Agency reported on Sunday.
“The city’s entrances are closed at Al-Nour Square, Qobba, Majdlya, Al-Shulfa-Zaghrta road, Badawi and Qalamoun toward the main highway [that leads to] Beirut,” the NNA added.
Sectarian clashes in the northern Lebanese port city of Tripoli over the past week have left 10 people dead and sparked fears that the deadly revolt sweeping Syria since March 2011 could spill over into Lebanon.
Tensions renewed on Sunday after Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard Mohammad Hussein Merheb were killed.
According to AFP, a security official said army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, Merheb, when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria.-NOW Lebanon
