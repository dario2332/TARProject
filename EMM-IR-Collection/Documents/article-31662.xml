Speaking shortly before boarding a flight to Moscow for meetings with his 
  counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Monday, the Foreign Secretary said that Russia 
  now faced a stark choice between using its leverage with the Assad regime or 
  risking it's last bastion of influence in the Middle East descending into 
Urging Moscow to put its full weight behind the six-point United Nations plan 
  brokered by the former secretary general Kofi Annan, he said: "The 
  Russians have a great deal of leverage over the Syrian regime.
"We've had many differences of view over Russia at the Security Council, 
  but Russia does support the Annan plan and so I hope Russia will redouble 
  its efforts to get the Assad regime to implement that plan," he said.
"It's not in the interests of Russia, just as it's not in the interests 
  of anybody in the world for Syria to descend in to an even bloodier 
  situation and in to full scale civil war and that is now the danger."
Russia's deputy ambassador to the UN cast doubt on the culpability of Syria's 
  government for a massacre of more than 100 people in the central town of

"We need to establish whether it was the Syrian authorities," Igor Pankin said 
  at the United Nations. "There are substantial grounds to believe that the 
  majority of those who were killed were either slashed, cut by knives, or 
  executed at point blank distance."
Mr Annan, the joint UN-Arab League envoy, is due to arrive in Damascus on 
  Monday morning for talks over the beleaguered Six-Point Plan to end the 
  violence and begin a political process in Syria.
Mr Hague, who said he was "sickened" by the images from the massacre 
  at Houla, has also called an emergency session of the UN Security Council 
  and summoned Syria's most senior diplomat to the Foreign Office for an 
  official dressing down. The council was due to meet on the issue last night.
The UK mission to Moscow came amid deepening international outrage over the 
  massacre which the head of the UN observer mission in Syria, Maj-Gen Robert 
  Mood, also warned would fan the flames of instability and "may lead the 
  country to civil war".
As violence continued in Syria, the Houla massacre has already stretched the 
  credibility of the UN mission in Syria, with the Free Syrian Army issuing a 
  statement saying that the deal was "going to hell" unless there 
  was concerted international intervention.
Before departing for Moscow, Mr Hague held talks with Kofi Annan, Mr Hague 
  said there was a "good case" for increasing the size of the 
  300-strong UN observer mission, but stressed that time was now running out 
  for the Six Point Plan, announced in April.
"I've discussed with him [Mr Annan] the urgency of getting a political 
  process going in Syria which is his objective before time runs out," he 
  added, "Time will run out before too long on that." As the 
  groundswell of Western condemnation grew - Russia remained silent - Syria "categorically" 
  denied responsibility for the killings at Houla blaming "terrorists" 
"Women, children and old men were shot dead. This is not the hallmark of 
  the heroic Syrian army," a Syrian foreign ministry spokesman said in 
  Damascus, who claimed that Syria was being subjected to a "tsunami of 
A British diplomatic source dismissed the denials, describing them as a 
  transparent and "concerning" attempt to "seek impunity and 
  lay the blame on others".
Mr Hague said that it was still too early to discuss military or other 
  interventions in Syria, and that for now all efforts were being focused on 
  trying to get the Annan plan to stick - although acknowledging that failure 
  would come with consequences.
"If we come to the point where the Annan plan has clearly failed, 
  Britain will be arguing for a stronger response from the world, from the 
  United Nations Security Council, increasing our support to the opposition, 
  imposing further sanctions and measures on the Syrian regime," he said.
In Washington, the Obama administration condemned the Houla massacre as the 
  work of the Assad regime, pledging that the "rule by murder" must 
  come to an end, without specifying measures.
The White House is reported to be focusing on pressuring the newly re-election 
  Russian president Vladimir Putin to back a deal that would ease out the 
  Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in a fix similar to that brokered in 
Under the deal, which White House officials said was under discussion, Mr 
  Assad would leave office as the first step in a developing a political 
  process, as happened with the former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
However both independent analysts and UK foreign office sources have expressed 
  skepticism over whether such a deal can be replicated in Syria, a security 
  state where Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect rules over a Sunni majority.
