  <text>Syrian activists say there have been explosions and clashes in several parts of the country even as the government claims it has started to withdraw troops from some cities in compliance with an international ceasefire plan.
Opposition figure Mohammed Saleh says there has been a series of loud blasts in the central Homs region and heavy machine-gun fire in parts of the old city.
Activist Mohammed Saeed in the Damascus suburb of Douma says regime troops were carrying out raids and arrests on Wednesday. He says tanks and checkpoints remain in place.
A Syrian government official had said on Tuesday that troops started pulling out from some calm cities and heading back to their bases, a week ahead of a deadline to implement international envoy Kofi Annan's truce plan.
