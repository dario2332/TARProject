  <text>A Syrian military offensive on Sunday left 33 people dead in and around the restive town of Hama, with seven children among the latest victims, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The London-based observatory said Monday that the central town had come under machine-gun and rocket fire just as the UN Security Council was holding an emergency session which condemned an earlier massacre in the country.
Five women and four military deserters were among the victims of Sunday's attack, said the observatory, which had previously put the toll at nine dead.
"There was fighting among soldiers and deserters. The soldiers were killed and the army responded violently, directly targeting residential areas," militants in Hama told AFP.
"People came out on to the streets shouting that they needed medical help. One house was bombarded and collapsed on its inhabitants," they added.
The new toll bought the number of people killed throughout the country on Sunday to 48.
The UN says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad Assad, while activists put the figure at over 13,000.
