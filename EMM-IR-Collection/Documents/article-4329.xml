The Sydney Morning Herald
A former student opened fire at random, killing at least seven people at the small Christian university, when he learned the female administrator he was looking for was not there, police say.
Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan told a news conference that the South Korean-born One L Goh went to the California school with "the intent of locating an administrator. He then went through the entire building systematically and randomly shooting victims."
"We do know that he was upset at administrators at the school. We do know that he was upset with several students here because of the way he was treated when he was enrolled here two months ago," Jordan said.
He said Goh had been teased, but he did not elaborate. The 43-year-old South Korean national had been expelled, possibly for behavioural problems, according to Jordan.
"We've learned that this was a very chaotic, calculated and determined gentleman that came there with a very specific intent to kill people, and that's what his motive was and that's what he carried out," Jordan told the TV show Good Morning America.
Those connected to the school, including the founder and several students, described the 43-year-old gunman as a former nursing student. The chief said Goh is a South Korean national.
Five died at the scene and another two died at the hospital. The wounded victims were in stable condition, and at least one person had been released from the hospital. Jordan told Good Morning America the victims ranged in age from 21 to 40.
Dawinder Kaur's family told the Oakland Tribune that she was being treated for a gunshot to her elbow.
The 19-year-old told her family that that the gunman was a student in her nursing class who had been absent for months before returning on Monday. The gunman entered the classroom and ordered students to line up against the wall.
When he showed his gun, students began running and he opened fire, her family said.
"She told me that a guy went crazy and she got shot," brother Paul Singh told the newspaper. "She was running. She was crying; she was bleeding, it was wrong."
Tashi Wangchuk, whose wife attended the school and witnessed the shooting, said he was told by police that the gunman first shot a woman at the front desk, then continued shooting randomly in classrooms.
Wangchuk said his wife, Dechen Wangzom, was in her nursing class when she heard gunshots. She locked the door and turned off the lights.
The gunman "banged on the door several times and started shooting outside and left," he said. Wangchuk said no one was hurt inside, but the gunman shot out the glass in the door. He said she did not know the man.
The suspect was detained at a supermarket about an hour after the shooting.
A security guard at the supermarket approached the man because he was acting suspiciously, KGO-TV reported. The man told the guard that he needed to talk to police because he shot people, and the guard called authorities.
"He didn't look like he had a sign of relief on him. He didn't look like he had much of any emotion on his face," said Lisa Resler, who was buying fruit at Safeway with her four-year-old daughter when she saw the man.
Goh also called his father soon after the shooting and told him what happened, the police chief said. The father also called authorities, Jordan said.
The suspect's brother was killed in a car accident last year in Virginia while on active duty in the US Army, according to Stars and Stripes newspaper. The suspect attended the funeral of Sergeant Su Wan Ko after the March 8, 2011, accident.
