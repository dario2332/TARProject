  <text>Amateur videos said to be taken in the aftermath showed row after row of victims, many of them small children with what appeared to be bullet holes in their temples, The New York Times reported. 
The rebel Free Syrian Army, the loose federation of armed militias across the country, issued a statement saying it was no longer committed to the United Nations truce plan because it was just buying time for the government to kill civilians and destroy cities and villages.
Western countries and Arab states opposed to Assad put the blame squarely on Damascus.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton spoke of a "heinous act perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its own civilian population" in a statement on Sunday. The head of the European parliament said it could amount to a war crime.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton demanded that those who carried out the killings be held to account.
"The United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end," she said.
France said it would call a meeting of the Friends of Syria, a group of Western and Arab countries keen to see Assad removed.
The United Arab Emirates requested an urgent meeting of the Arab League, whose head, Nabil Elaraby, urged the U.S. Security Council to stop the killing.
But there was no immediate official word from Russia, which along with China has vetoed council resolutions calling for tougher action.
In its report, the United Nations statement stopped short of accusing the government of responsibility for the entire toll.
Gen. Robert Mood, the head of the United Nations observer mission in Syria, said in a statement that "the killing of innocent children and civilians needs to stop," but added that the circumstances behind all the deaths remained "unclear."
Although the ceasefire plan negotiated by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has failed to stop the violence, the United Nations is nearing full deployment of a 300-strong unarmed observer force meant to monitor a truce.
The plan calls for a truce, withdrawal of troops from cities and dialogue between the government and opposition.
