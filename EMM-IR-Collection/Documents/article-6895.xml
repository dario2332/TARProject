A day before a planned ceasefire, activists and rebels claim Syria's government is increasing attacks, causing hundreds of deaths.
AS SPECIAL envoy Kofi Annan's Syria peace plan appeared to unravel - with the Assad regime and the opposition locked in a war of words over proposed troop withdrawals - reports have emerged of extra-judicial executions of civilians and wounded rebel fighters.
Contradicting its earlier agreement to implement Mr Annan's plan by today's deadline, Syria's Foreign Ministry placed new caveats on the agreement, demanding written guarantees from opposition fighters that they will lay down their weapons before any troop withdrawal begins.
In turn, Syria's main opposition group, the Syrian National Council, has agreed to provide a written assurance, while the Free Syrian Army says it will only negotiate with the international community. Previously, Syria had agreed to the plan set out by Mr Annan, the former UN secretary-general, in which troops were to be withdrawn by today, with a ceasefire to take effect 48 hours later.

It is the first part of a six-point plan endorsed by all members of the UN Security Council. The plan aims to start negotiations between the Assad regime and Syria's divided opposition groups, and allow humanitarian aid to reach a population in which at least 9000 have died and many more have been injured since January 2011. But the Assad regime has escalated its violent crackdown on civilians across the country, with reports emerging of troops beating and burning people to death as well as scores of new casualties and fatalities.
Syrian forces have fired across the border at protesters  at a refugee camp in Turkey, wounding a Turkish translator and at least  two Syrian refugees,  authorities say.
A government official said Turkey immediately protested the incident  to the Syrian charge d'affaires and asked that the fire be halted.
International analysts fear that as President Bashar al-Assad's troops  crush the poorly armed rebel forces, there is less reason than ever for the regime to go down the diplomatic path.
''It is clear the Assad forces have been able to break the rebels in quite a few places and the idea the rebels could consolidate control over large areas of territory is no longer credible,'' said Richard Gowan, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
A Human Rights Watch report released yesterday catalogues more than 100 executions in Syria, many in the past month.
The report details the involvement of Syrian forces and pro-government  militias in summary and extrajudicial executions in Idlib and Homs.
''They are doing it in broad daylight and in front of witnesses, evidently not concerned about any accountability for their crime,'' said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch.
At least 85 victims were Syrian residents who did not take part in the fighting, including women and children.
The report describes several cases of mass executions of civilians, including at least 13 men in the Bilal mosque in Idlib on March 11  and at least 47 people, mainly women and children, in several areas of Homs on March 11 and 12.
