  <text>Captain Stephen Healey, 29, from Cardiff, was talented footballer before joining Royal Welch Fusiliers
An army officer who was killed by a home-made bomb in Afghanistan packed more into his three decades alive than most people do into a lifetime, his family said.
Captain Stephen Healey, 29, of 1st Battalion the Royal Welsh (the Royal Welch Fusiliers), was killed on Saturday when his patrol vehicle hit the improvised explosive device in the north of the Nahr-e Saraj District in Helmand province. He was flown to the military hospital at Camp Bastion, where he was pronounced dead.
On Sunday, his father John, mother Kerry, brother Simon and girlfriend Thea paid tribute to Captain Healey, a former semi-professional footballer from Cardiff.
They issued a statement saying: "Stephen was all you could wish for in a son, brother, uncle and friend. He will be sadly missed by us all."
