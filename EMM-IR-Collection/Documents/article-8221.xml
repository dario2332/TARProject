(CNN) -- International envoy Kofi Annan on Wednesday expressed hope that Syria's warring sides will meet a looming deadline to end hostilities as he urged Iran to support the peace effort.
"I have received government assurances they will respect the cease-fire" by the Thursday deadline, Annan said during a visit to Iran.
Annan, the U.N. and Arab League envoy, was in Tehran to seek support for the peace efforts.
"I am grateful for the support of Iran given its special relations with Syria and I believe Iran can be part of the solution," Annan said.
His peace plan calls for the government and the opposition to lay down their weapons. by 6 a.m. Thursday local time. (11 p.m. ET Wednesday)
Syria's self-imposed deadline to pull back government forces came and went Tuesday as attacks continued, killing 101 people that day, opposition activists said.
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Annan called on the parties to honor the peace plan.
"If you want to take it off the table, what would you replace it with?" he asked. "Let me once again appeal to the Syrian government, to all the parties, to cease violence according to the plan."
Syrians in besieged areas are not as optimistic, and accused the government of lying to the special envoy.
"The Annan plan will not succeed because I do not think Assad's forces will carry out the cease-fire," said Saif al-Arab, a Homs activist. "Assad will not withdraw his army and his military from Homs. He is attempting to suppress the revolution by lying and dodging any demands by the international community."
Al-Arab urged the international community to arm the rebel fighters to help them counter the government forces.
"The solution is to arm the Free Syrian Army with high quality weapons," he said. "They are still using Kalashnikov and light rocket-propelled grenades against the regime's military tanks."
The Syrian government said it took steps to ease back its forces, but Annan countered that while they had moved out of some areas, they had relocated into others that have not been previously targeted.
And as the military operation appeared to be widening, some rebel-held areas continued to be targeted.
Sporadic mortar shelling and rocket fire hit neighborhoods in Homs early Wednesday, killing at least one, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Two other deaths occurred in the town of Qouriya in Deir Ezzor province, the group said.
"Military planes have been hovering over Homs skies since the early hours," Al-Arab said . "And some shelling already started today. Usually planes fly for a while looking for what they perceive as targets then the shelling follows."
CNN cannot independently verify reports of violence and deaths as the government has severely restricted access by international media.
Syrian activists had angry words for Annan, saying the peace process was giving the regime more time to kill.
During his visit to refugee camps in Turkey, refugees frustrated with the peace process yelled "liar, liar!" at Annan, according to camp resident Mohamed El Abd. More than 24,000 Syrians have crossed the border.
Al-Assad's regime had agreed to the deadline, but demanded that its opponents, whom it calls armed terrorists, put down their weapons. It also wanted a promise from foreign governments not to fund opposition groups.
Annan's six-point peace plan also calls for a halt in violence by both sides and a Syrian-led political process.
It is vital that regional leaders, including Iran, work with Syria to resolve the crisis, he said.
"What's important is that the governments in the region and beyond work together with the Syrians to resolve this current crisis," he said. "This is a region that has seen many tensions and many shocks, and I don't think it can afford another shock."
Syrians' anti-government protests started in March 2011, followed by a violent crackdown by the regime. The United Nations estimates that the violence in Syria has killed at least 9,000 people. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria puts the toll at more than 11,000.
