  <text>White House hopeful Mitt Romney on Friday accused President Barack Obama of  attacking economic, religious and individual freedoms as the presumptive  Republican nominee wooed gun owners.
His appearance at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting came as the  nation is embroiled in a debate over gun control, racism and the criminal  justice system following the shooting of a black teen by a neighbourhood watch  guard.
Romney barely touched upon gun control and made no mention of the  controversial "Stand Your Ground" laws which led police to initially decline to  file charges in the Florida slaying of Treyvon Martin (17), because they  determined it was a justifiable homicide.
Shooting suspect George Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on  Wednesday after a special prosecutor had been appointed to review the case.
Instead, Romney stuck to his stump speech as he urged the powerful gun  lobby's members to join him in the fight to "take back our nation and defend our  freedoms."
"This administration's attack on freedom extends even to rights explicitly  guaranteed by our constitution," Romney told a crowd of 5500 NRA members  gathered in a football stadium attached to the St Louis convention center where  hundreds of exhibitors displayed acres of guns and gear.
Romney vowed to "stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those  seeking to protect their homes and their families" and "defend the rights  President Obama ignores or minimises".
The White House dismissed the accusation that Obama has undermined gun rights  guaranteed by the second amendment to the Constitution.
"The president is focused on common sense actions that protect the Second  Amendment rights of Americans while ensuring that those who should not have guns  under existing law do not get guns," spokesperson Jay Carney told reporters,  referring to the constitutional portion on the right to bear arms.
The NRA &amp;mdash; which calls itself the nation's oldest civil rights group &amp;mdash; is an  influential and highly symbolic lobby group, able to rally millions of dedicated  supporters. Romney was not alone in seeking its approval.
The presumptive Republican nominee was joined by rival Newt Gingrich and a  virtual who's who of the Republican establishment.
Gingrich called for a new United Nations treaty that would give the right to  bear arms to every person on the planet "because every person on the planet  deserves the right to defend themselves from those who would oppress them,  exploit them, rape them, or kill them".
Rick Santorum, who this week suspended his campaign for the Republican  presidential nomination, also rallied the crowd in a sign that he has deferred  rather than abandoned his political ambitions.
The NRA did not endorse Romney, who has been criticised for enacting gun  control legislation while governor of Massachusetts, but urged members to fight  hard to defeat Obama in November.
"If President Obama gets a second term, America as we know it will be on its  way to being lost forever," said NRA chief Wayne LaPierre.
"This election &amp;mdash; it's a fight for our country. It's a fight for our values.  It's a fight for our freedom."
Like Romney, LaPierre focused on the November election and made little  mention of gun control laws.
While the NRA has been instrumental in introducing Stand Your Ground  legislation in 30 states &amp;mdash; laws which now are at risk of repeal &amp;mdash; it has not  spoken out publically about the Trayvon Martin case.
The omission was deliberate.
"Charlton Heston used to say, 'Sometimes silence is the right thing to do',"  LaPierre told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. "And that really is the case  here."
However, at a small seminar on grassroots campaigning in an election year  where no news cameras were present, a top NRA executive vowed to defend the  laws.
"We don't apologise for supporting legislation that recognises our rights to  defend ourselves," said Chris Cox, director of the NRA's Institute for  Legislative Action.
