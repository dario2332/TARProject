  <text>The UN and Arab League international envoy Kofi Annan says he expects the situation in Syria to start improving when an armistice between the Army and the opposition is proclaimed on Thursday, April 12th.
Mr. Annan told a news conference in Tehran earlier today that further escalation of the armed conflict would prove disastrous and result in unthinkable consequences.
An armed standoff between the authorities and the opposition has been on in Syria for more than a year now.
According to the UN, the death toll has exceeded 9,000. Damascus assured Moscow on Tuesday that it has started implementing the Kofi Annan peace plan.
Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition has said it will cease fire if the government troops pull out of cities until Thursday.
