  <text>"We call on the people to demonstrate and express themselves, because the right to demonstrate is a principle point of the plan" of the UN-Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan, Burhan Ghalioun told AFP hours after the truce took effect.
The ceasefire was part of a six-point peace plan that Syria agreed with Annan, under which the government is to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully.
Syria ceasefire comes into effect
A ceasefire for Syria proposed by UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan has taken effect at 6 a.m. local time to become the first truce since the country was hit by a wave of clashes between the army and rebels.
The Syrian National Council backed by the West, Turkey and Arab oil-producing monarchies earlier said that if the army would not stop attacks, neither would the opposition.
Having announced a ceasefire, Damascus stressed that the army remains on alert in case of new extremist attacks.
Speaking during the G8 meeting in Washington, Russia`s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described Annan`s plans as 'realistic', urging all nations to ensure its implementation in full.
