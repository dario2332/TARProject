  <text>DAMASCUS, Dec 5, (Agencies): Syria said Monday it will accept observers as part of an Arab League plan to end deadly unrest if its conditions are met, in a last-ditch bid to stave off crippling sanctions.
“The Syrian government responded positively to the signing of the protocol” on sending observers “based on the Syrian understanding of this cooperation,” foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdisi told reporters.
Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said he received a letter from Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem outlining his government’s about-face but which contained “new demands.”
“We’ve contacted Arab foreign ministers and they have been apprised of the Syrian letter,” Arabi said, adding consultations were underway. Muallem had sent the letter late Sunday as a League deadline was set to expire.
Damascus has refused to sign the proposal, arguing the text undermines its sovereignty, prompting the Arab League on November 27 to impose sweeping sanctions on Syria.
The Arab bloc warned Saturday of new punitive measures against Syria unless it allows monitors access to the country where the UN estimates a crackdown on anti-regime protests has killed more than 4,000 people since March.
The international community wants monitors in Syria to keep a check on President Bashar al-Assad’s forces who have been accused by the United Nations of rights abuses.
Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said on Monday he was consulting Arab foreign ministers on Syria’s last-ditch effort to avoid new sanctions by offering to allow an observer mission into the country “with conditions.”
The Arab bloc had warned it would impose sweeping sanctions on Syria, where the UN estimates a crackdown on anti-regime protests has cost more than 4,000 lives, unless Damascus allowed monitors access to the country.
Jordan has told the Arab League it does not want to impose trade sanctions and a flight ban on neighbouring Syria, the foreign ministry said on Monday.
“We asked the Arab League ministerial committee in Doha last Saturday to exclude Jordan’s trade and aviation sectors from the sanctions,” foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Kayed told AFP.
“We support Arab League decisions, but Jordan will be affected negatively by the sanctions, which will harm our interests.”
Syrian security forces on Monday shot dead five civilians in Homs province, a day after at least 30 people died in violence in the flashpoint central region, a human rights group said.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported mutinous soldiers killed four security force members, including an officer, at the southern protest hub of Dael in Daraa province.
Thirty-four Syrians abducted by pro-regime “shabiha” militiamen on Monday were found dead in the flashpoint central city of Homs, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The Britain-based watchdog said that an activist on the ground said that he “saw the bodies of 34 civilians, in a square in the pro-regime neighbourhood of Al-Zahra, who had been abducted by the shabiha on Monday.”
The report said the civilians had been seized from several “anti-regime neighbourhoods” in the central city of Homs, which has been targeted by a brutal crackdown on almost nine months of anti-regime dissent.
The United States and Turkey are reviewing how to help Syria if pro-democracy protests drive President Basher al -Assad from power, US Vice President Joe Biden said on Sunday, but the two allies have not discussed concrete “next steps”.
Washington and Ankara have both called for Assad to go, but both worry it could deepen instability in a region already rocked by the Arab Spring, and as US troops leave Iraq by the end of the month.
The Syrian military has held war games that included test-firing of missiles and air force and ground troop operations “similar to a real battle,” state-run media reported Monday — a show of force as Damascus defies pressures over its deadly crackdown on regime opponents.
The maneuvers, which state TV said took place over the weekend, came as Syria said it was still negotiating with the Arab League over the bloc’s request to send observers into the country. Tightening sanctions by Arab and other nations have failed to halt the crackdown on anti-government protesters.
Turkey dismissed a decision by Syria to scrap a free trade agreement between the two countries in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Ankara, saying Damascus should use “common sense” as it would be the Syrian people and businesses that would suffer.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s cabinet voted over the weekend to suspend the pact with Turkey introduced in 2007 and impose a tariff of 30 percent on all Turkish imports and prohibitive duties on fuel and freight.
