  <text>Speaker Nabih Berri called Grand Mufti of the Lebanese Republic, Sheikh Mohammad Rashid Qabbani, and discussed with him the incident that led to the death of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed, according to a statement issued by Berri’s press office.
“Berri contacted Qabbani and offered his condolences for [the death] of Abdel Wahed and informed him of the efforts made by President [Michel Sleiman], Prime Minister [Najib Mikati] and Lebanese army Commander General [Jean Kahwaji] to speed up the investigation into the incident and maintain [national] security,” the statement said.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed. -NOW Lebanon
