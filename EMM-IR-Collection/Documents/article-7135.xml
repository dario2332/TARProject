Syria's foreign minister says Damascus wants guarantees from Kofi Annan that armed groups attacking its troops will commit to a ceasefire under a UN-backed peace plan.
The United Nations-Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, has said his peace plan to stop the violence in Syria is still on the table, despite reports of fresh violence.
He was speaking at a news conference in Turkey, after visiting some of the camps to where an estimated 25,000 people have fled from Syria to escape the violence.
Mr Annan appealed on all parties to stop the violence, saying there was still time between now and Thursday for a ceasefire.
"I again appeal to the Syrian government and the Syrian parties to cease violence in accordance (with) the plan," he said.
"I believe there should be no preconditions for stopping violence."
Walid Muallem is in Moscow for talks in an attempt to persuade Russia to maintain support for the Assad regime.
He said Mr Annan told him in a recent telephone call that a ceasefire in the country would be followed by disarming of the rebels.
Opposition activists have reported new Syrian tank and mortar fire in the cities of Homs and Hama. They say insurgents killed six soldiers on the day President Bashar al-Assad was to withdraw his forces 48 hours ahead of a planned ceasefire.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the soldiers were killed in attacks on two checkpoints on the highway running through Marqada, south of the Turkish border.
Reports from Syria cannot be independently verified as the government has barred international journalists and rights groups.
There has been no report of the attacks from the official Syrian news agency, SANA.
Syria says it has already pulled back some of its troops from the cities in keeping with its undertaking to the UN-Arab League envoy.
His peace plan calls for rebel forces to stop shooting as the army withdraws so that all forms of violence cease at dawn on Thursday.
The Observatory, a British-based activist information centre, said there was no clear sign of troop withdrawals.
It reported a clash between rebels and army in Deraa in the far south and said the battered opposition stronghold of Khalidiya in the city of Homs was again heavily shelled.
In Douma, a suburb of the capital Damascus, an activist said tanks were still on the fringes of town this morning.
China, which along with Russia, has blocked UN Security Council action against Syria, said it hoped all sides would immediately obey the ceasefire.
The US said yesterday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had shown no sign so far that his government was sticking by the peace plan after signing the deal last week.
At least 105 people were killed yesterday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said after weekend violence claimed almost 180 lives, most of them civilians.
Deaths were reported for the first time across the border in Turkey and Lebanon, triggering an angry rebuke from the US.
Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama in the early hours this morning, an activist said, and tanks continued to patrol the streets.
