  <text>MTV reported on Sunday that Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed’s relatives refused to take the sheikh’s body before knowing who killed him and before the perpetrators were tried.
The station added that despite efforts to maintain calm in Halba, the situation was still “tense” and roads were still blocked by burning tires.
Army troops shot dead Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. -NOW Lebanon
