  <text>Confrontation: Tear gas smoke rises in the air as young demonstrators get ready to throw rocks at security forces in Tahrir
Surrounded: Egyptian riot police grab a protestor in the square as they attempt to clear a tented sit-in after a 50,000-strong rally
Military police in riot gear stormed the square in an attempt to seize control from protesters who had set up camp there following a 50,000-strong protest against the military rulers on Friday.
They set fire to tents, fired tear gas rounds and beat the crowd with truncheons. At one point they appeared to be in control but running battles are now being fought.
After clashes that lasted for much of yesterday, security forces eventually pulled back into the surrounding streets, leaving thousands of protesters in control.
Early today, rocks, shattered glass and rubbish covered most of the area with several hundred people camping out on the lawn of the square's traffic island.
All roads leading to it were blocked by protesters who ran ID checks on anyone coming into the plaza.
Aflame: The protest tents put up by the crowds of demonstrators burn out of control after being set on fire by soldiers and police in Tahrir Square
Wounded: A victim of the violence near the square is taken to hospital on a scooter by two friends
Protected: Protesters hide behind a portion of a fence as police fire tear gas and throw stones back at them
As night fell hundreds of protesters were making their way back to the square, waving the red, white and black Egyptian flags and chanting 'Allahu Akbar' or God is greatest.
Three of the dead were killed in the Tahrir assault by police, according to doctors.
More than 670 people have been injured. One of those wounded in Cairo, Ahmed Mahmoud, 23, later died 
in hospital, while a protester was reported to have been killed in Alexandria outside the offices of the interior ministry.
A witness heard repeated gunfire in the 
area. It was not clear whether the shots were live bullets. One person 
covered in blood was carried off to hospital on a motorcycle.
Protesters at Tahrir were using social networking 
sites on the internet to call on Egyptians to join them and 
there were reports of several demonstrations headed to the square, 
including one from Cairo University.
