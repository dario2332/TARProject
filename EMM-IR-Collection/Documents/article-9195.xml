  <text>A UN-brokered truce is keeping the guns silent in Syria - so far. ITN's Paul Davis reports.
Updated 11:50 a.m. ET: Syria has not fully complied with the terms of a peace plan, U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan told the Security Council on Thursday as a fragile cease-fire appeared to be holding.
Annan urged the 15-nation body to demand the withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from towns, according to an official who was present.
Aside from a shooting a checkpoint in Hama, Syrian troops held their fire in the hours after a U.N.-backed cease-fire took effect at dawn on Thursday, casting a silence over rebellious towns they had bombarded heavily in recent days.
Annan told council members that Syria's fragile truce needs support and called for the swift deployment of a first wave of unarmed observers to monitor implementation of his six-point peace plan, to be followed by a second wave of observers later, diplomats told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The former U.N. secretary-general said earlier in a statement that "Syria is experiencing a rare moment of calm on the ground," adding that it "must be sustained."
"The Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, will be asking the Security Council for approval of the deployment of a U.N. Observer Mission as soon as possible," Annan said in a statement.
"This will allow us to move quickly to launch a serious political dialogue that will address the concerns and aspirations of the Syrian people," he said.
Annan's six-point plan calls for a cease-fire by Syrian armed forces and rebels and dialogue between the government and opposition aimed at a "political transition" for the country.

"Partially observed"?  You can't partially observe a cease-fire.
That's like me saying I'm still partially observing my virginity even though I got laid last night.
