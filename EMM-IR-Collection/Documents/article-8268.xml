UNITED NATIONS, April 10, 2012 (AFP) - The UN Security Council on Tuesday called on President Bashar al-Assad to keep a Thursday deadline for a complete ceasefire in the deadly Syria conflict.
And US ambassador Susan Rice said the 15-nation council may soon face "a moment of truth" over the crisis after Assad failed to keep a commitment to withdraw troops and heavy guns from cities.
Rice read a council statement backing a demand by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan for the Syrian government to make a "fundamental change of course" to end hostilities by 6:00 am Damascus time on Thursday.
After Annan appealed for new UN backing, Security Council members expressed "deep concern" at the Syrian government's commitment to the Annan peace plan and "stressed the importance that the parties meet the deadline of April 12."
Council members also "underscored" Annan's statement that "the Syrian leadership should now seize the opportunity to make a fundamental change of course," Rice said.
"It is essential that the next 48 hours bring visible signs of immediate and indisputable change in the military posture of the government forces throughout the country" as set out in Annan's six-point plan, the statement said.
Syria had originally agreed to pull troops and guns out of population zones by Tuesday.
Annan said that despite the failure to keep the commitment, it was still possible to reach a target of a complete ceasefire by Thursday.
The envoy is to brief the Security Council on Thursday and Rice said that a crunch moment is looming for the international community. She said the main "deadline" for the Security Council was on Tuesday.
"Members of the council are unified in their grave concern that this deadline has passed and the violence has not only continued but over the last 10 days has intensified," she said.
The United States believes that "we face a moment of truth coming up," Rice said.
The Security Council will have to decide whether it is to remain united behind the Annan plan and is ready "to take the logical next step which is to increase the pressure on the Assad regime through collective action."
