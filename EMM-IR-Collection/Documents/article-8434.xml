UNITED NATIONS (AP) — International envoy Kofi Annan says he has been informed by the Syrian government that it will "cease all military fighting throughout Syrian territory" as of 6 a.m. Damascus time on Thursday.
Annan's spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said in a statement Wednesday that the letter from Syria's foreign minister said the government reserves "the right to respond proportionately to any attacks carried out by armed terrorist groups against civilians, government forces or public and private property."
Fawzi said Annan will continue to work with the Syrian government on implementation of his six-point plan to end the more than yearlong conflict in which more than 9,000 people have been killed, according to the U.N.
