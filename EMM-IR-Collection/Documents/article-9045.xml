  <text>A fragile ceasefire brokered by the UN took hold in Syria on Thursday with regime forces apparently halting widespread attacks on the opposition, but there were reports of scattered violence and the government defied demands by international envoy Kofi Annan to pull troops back to barracks.
A civilian and a Syrian soldier were reported killed after the 6 a.m. ceasefire deadline, but there was no sign of the normally intense shelling, rocket attacks and sniper fire that have become routine.
If the truce holds, it would be the first time the regime has observed an internationally brokered ceasefire since Bashar Assad's regime launched a brutal crackdown 13 months ago on mass protests calling for his ouster.
However, troops intensified searches at checkpoints, tightening controls ahead of possible large-scale protests Friday called by the opposition and meant to test the regime's commitment to the Annan plan.

In Geneva Thursday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the 'onus is on [the] Syria' government to keep its promise and hold to a ceasefire.
There was deep skepticism that the regime would halt its fire for long, given that Assad has broken promises in the past. Also, the regime said Wednesday, on the eve of the truce deadline, that it reserves the right to respond to any aggression, potentially a pretext for breaking the truce.
Annan's plan calls for the deployment of international observers and talks on a political transition once a truce is in place. The initiative has broad international support, including from Assad allies Russia, China and Iran, and is widely seen as the last chance for diplomacy to end the violence. The increasingly militarized uprising has been veering toward an armed insurgency.
The West and its allies doubt the sincerity of the regime's pledges to comply with the truce plan, which calls on the Syrian government to allow peaceful protests. A prolonged ceasefire could threaten the regime by encouraging large numbers of protesters to flood the streets, as they did at the start of the revolt against the four-decade rule of the Assad clan. The government met those demonstrations with a harsh crackdown, and more than 9,000 people have died since, according to the UN.
Burhan Ghalioun, head of the opposition Syrian National Council, urged Syrians to demonstrate peacefully on Friday. Protests are common on Fridays after Muslims crowd mosques for noon prayers.
"Tomorrow, like every Friday, the Syrian people are called to demonstrate even more and put the regime in front of its responsibilities — put the international community in front of its responsibilities," he said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says Canada will offer help resettle Syrian refugees if the United Nations asks, and will look at fast-tracking claimants.
Speaking on CBC News Network's Power &amp;; Politics with Evan Solomon, Kenney said the Syrians first will have to be assessed by the UN to confirm they are refugees.
"If there's an urgent need to resettle Syrian refugees, we will certainly be prepared to co-operate," Kenney said.
Tens of thousands of Syrians have fled the fierce fighting in their country. Many have gone to the border area with Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.
Analyst Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, said while the ceasefire is fragile, the apparent halt in government attacks suggests Assad's allies are pressuring him for the first time, after shielding him from international condemnation in the past. Annan has visited Russia, Iran and China in his attempt to get the broadest possible backing for the plan.
Annan is to brief the UN Security Council by video conference from Geneva on Thursday afternoon.
Both the government and the opposition have said they will abide by the truce, which began at 6 a.m. local Thursday.
All the flashpoints of the uprising were reported quiet in the hours after the truce took hold. The central provinces of Hama and Homs, the northern regions of Idlib and Aleppo, the capital Damascus and its suburbs, as well as Daraa to the south and Deir el-Zour to the east were all calm, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
However, troops, tanks and armoured personnel carriers continued to patrol several opposition strongholds, including Damascus and the city of Homs, activists said.
"There have been no withdrawals from checkpoints but calm is prevailing in all areas in Syria," said Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory.
Another activist group, the grassroots Local Coordination Committees, said regime forces carried out arrests in the Damascus suburb of Maadamiyah shortly after reinforcements entered the area.
It also reported anti-regime protests at universities in the southern city of Daraa and the eastern city of Deir el-Zour, and a protest march in the northern village of Tamanaa.
The regime ignored a Tuesday deadline for withdrawing troops from population centres, prompting renewed demands by Annan that forces return to their barracks.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu demanded that the Syrian troops withdraw, saying that "keeping the cities under pressure is not meaningful."
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey could seek NATO's help in case the Syrian troops violate its borders again. Syrian forces opened fire across the Turkish border on Monday, killing two people in a Turkish refugee camp.
Assad apparently is unwilling to ease control over opposition areas for fear of widespread anti-government protests.
A major test could come on Friday. Since the outbreak of the protests in March 2011, thousands have taken to the streets every week after Friday noon prayers in the mosques.
The military crackdown over the past year succeeded in preventing protesters from recreating the fervour of Egypt's Tahrir Square, where hundreds of thousands of people camped out in a powerful show of dissent that drove longtime leader Hosni Mubarak from power.
The government denies that it is facing a popular uprising, claiming instead that terrorists are carrying out a foreign conspiracy to destroy Syria.
