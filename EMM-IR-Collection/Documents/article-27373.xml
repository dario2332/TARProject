Lebanese security officials confirmed the kidnapping.
Hezbollah has stood by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as he struggles to put down a 15-month-old uprising.
UprisingSunnis form the backbone of the Syrian revolt, which has unleashed boiling sectarian tensions. Assad and the ruling elite in Syria belong to the tiny Alawite sect, an off-shoot of Shiism.
Within hours of the kidnappings, the Syrian government began moving into Azaz in Aleppo province, where the abductions took place, activists said.
Lebanese Sunni groups supporting and opposing the Damascus regime fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in Beirut early on Monday, killing at least two people. It was among the most serious fighting in the capital since 2008.
Earlier this month, the arrest of Shadi Mawlawi, an outspoken Lebanese critic of Assad, set off several days of clashes in northern Lebanon that killed eight people. Mawlawi was accused of belonging to a terrorist group.
