  <text>Calling for a "return to dialogue and the negotiating table", the spokesman said: "We want calm and we wish Mr Annan well."
The Houla massacre is one of the deadliest attacks since the start of the Syrian uprising 15 months ago.
UN monitors have confirmed at least 90 people, including 32 children, were killed.
The UN says Syrian government forces shelled the town before moving in on foot.
Witnesses say men were shot in the streets and women and children were stabbed in their homes.
Amateur videos posted on YouTube showed horrifying images of dead children, with at least one child's head partly blown away.
Another video posted on YouTube showed a mass grave filled with bodies wrapped in white sheets.
Angry residents have voiced their frustration.
"Some of the children were less than eight months old. What did they do? Did they also carry rocket-propelled grenades? " one man shouted at a visibly embarrassed UN observer.
"We are human. Doesn't the regime fear God?" he added.
The UN has called it an appalling and brutal crime, while the US labelled it an atrocity.
Australia is pushing for stronger UN action, including tougher sanctions.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr says he has asked Australia's ambassador to the United Nations to start discussing tougher sanctions against Syria with other governments.
He described the Houla massacre as hideous, and says no effort should be spared in bringing those responsible to justice.
He says those responsible for the killings in Syria could be referred to the International Criminal Court.
"I'd like to see sanctions strengthened, all of us would, but we want to stop short of hurting the Syrian people, " Senator Carr said.
As the Syrian government denied responsibility for the massacre, it kept up its shelling of neighbourhoods in the central city of Hama, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said
The Observatory said the town of Rastan to its south came under artillery fire for a 14th straight day.
Rebel fighters who pulled out of the flashpoint central city of Homs earlier this year in the face of a devastating assault by the army are holed up in Rastan, activists say.
"The town is being hit at a rate of two shells a minute," the observatory said.
Troops loyal to Mr Assad also clashed with rebel fighters in the town of Harasta near Damascus.
