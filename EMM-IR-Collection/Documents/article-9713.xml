The UN Security Council will today vote on a Western-drafted resolution allowing a ceasefire observer mission in Syria even though Russia's support is in doubt.
The US called for the vote after a second day of wrangling with Russia over security guarantees for the first 30 unarmed military monitors who UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan wants in Syria early next week.
Russia also opposed the council demanding that President Bashar al-Assad carry out a promise to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from Syrian cities.
Russia and China have vetoed two previous Security Council resolutions on Syria.
Negotiations had been "rather difficult," he said while insisting that Russia wants a vote today that allows the Syrian ceasefire to be "reinforced".
Neither the US nor its allies are certain that the resolution would escape a new veto.
"It would be wise not to make predictions," said US ambassador Susan Rice.
"A veto cannot be ruled out," said one Security Council diplomat. "It would be catastrophic for Syria if it happens."
A new version of the resolution drafted by the US, Britain and France was sent to other council members late yesterday for national governments to decide which way to vote.
Russia has also registered a shorter version of the draft for an eventual vote.
Both versions authorise the first 30 monitors in a force in Syria that would grow to more than 200 if the ceasefire started on Thursday holds.
However, rights groups have said that Syrian troops shelled two neighbourhoods of the central city of Homs this morning.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that one civilian was killed in the attack.
Reports from Syria cannot be independently verified as the government has barred international journalists and rights groups.
The UN says well over 9,000 people have been killed since an uprising against Mr Assad started 13 months ago.
