  <text>Ban called on Assad's regime to keep its pledge to immediately halt violence
Ban accused the Syrian regime of perpetrating "unacceptable levels of violence" in a "stepped-up security crackdown." He said it had led to "massive human rights violations."
The UN chief added that there had only been "small progress" in the implementation of the plan, which was brokered by international envoy Kofi Annan.
A spokesman for Annan said on Friday that the envoy was making plans to return to Syria early next week. It will be his first trip to the country since presenting the plan, which stipulates that UN observer teams monitor the regime's adherence to the April 12 cease-fire.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 12,600 people have been killed in Syria in the 14-month-long revolt against Assad's rule, including nearly 1,500 since the UN truce came into effect.

At least 50 civilians have been killed by Syrian forces in Homs province, an activist group has reported. The latest violence came as the UN secretary general condemned the lack of progress towards peace in Syria.
Bankia has confirmed that it plans to seek the largest government bailout of a Spanish bank to date. The move had been widely expected but the sum requested was much higher than had been feared.
Police say that they have detained an individual on suspicion of leaking confidential Vatican documents. Unconfirmed media sources allege that the man is Pope Benedict XVI's butler.
Partial results from the first round of Egypt's presidential election indicate that in the run-off, voters will have to choose between a member of the former Mubarak regime and the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate.
