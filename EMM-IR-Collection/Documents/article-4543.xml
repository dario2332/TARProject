Syria has accepted an April 10  deadline to comply with the conditions laid out by international envoy  Kofi Annan, which include withdrawing government forces from populated  areas and observing a cease-fire &amp;mdash; first by the regime, then by the  rebels &amp;mdash; and talks by all sides on a political solution.
The plan  also calls for an immediate daily two-hour halt to fighting so  humanitarian aid can reach suffering civilians, as well as unhindered  access for aid groups and journalists.
Opposition activists have  blasted the plan as too little, too late and for not stipulating that  Assad must leave power. They also accuse him of stalling so he can  continue his crackdown on dissent.
He said before his visit he would appeal  for greater access to the sick, wounded and displaced, as well as for  the two-hour daily halt to the fighting to allow aid access.
The  regime has verbally accepted other peace plans in recent months only to  ignore them on the ground. An Arab League effort that included sending  in monitors to promote a cease-fire collapsed in violence in November.
The  latest violence shows how little effect international diplomacy has had  on violence in Syria more than one year after the start of a popular  uprising, which began with peaceful protests but escalated into armed  conflict. The U.N. says more than 9,000 people have been killed.
Opposition groups reported army raid and arrest campaigns across the country on Tuesday as well as clashes with local rebels.
The  Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said two civilians  were killed in clashes in the northern village of Taftanaz, where rebel  destroyed one army vehicle and regime forces torched a number of homes.
Gunmen in the northern city of Aleppo attacked the  home of the head of military institutions late Monday and killed two  guards, the groups said.
