It is understood the first international ceasefire monitors will arrive in Syria tomorrow.
Some 30 unarmed observers will be sent to Syria over the coming days after their deployment was unanimously backed by the UN Security Council.
The news comes amid reports Bashar Al-Assad's forces have broken Kofi Annan's ceasefire plan and launched attacks in Aleppo and Homs.
The advance team of 30 is set to leave for the conflict zone amid reports that renewed shelling in the city of Homs and elsewhere is putting the fragile cessation of hostilities at risk.
Russia, which has vetoed two previous resolutions, approved the text which said both sides should “cease all armed violence in all its forms”.
The resolution also called on the government of president Bashar Assad to implement the peace plan devised by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan which includes the withdrawal of troops.
