  <text>BEIJING, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council will meet Saturday to vote on a draft resolution that would authorize an advance team to monitor a ceasefire in Syria in a bid to end the 13-month-long crisis.
The United States and its allies submitted a draft resolution on Friday while Russia put forward a rival one, which differed on whether Syria should give immediate guarantees of freedom of access to the mission, and whether the council should warn Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of further measures if he does not keep his commitments to a ceasefire with armed opposition groups.
Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin criticized the U.S. draft for being too ambitious, saying, "We have put together a shorter version of (the U.S.) text."
The draft resolutions, which would allow up to 30 unarmed military observers for Syria, came after Kofi Annan, the joint UN and Arab League special envoy on Syria, requested UN observers monitor compliance with a six-point peace plan agreed upon by both Assad and the opposition groups.
Under the plan, the Syrian government must withdraw its troops by April 10, and a complete ceasefire should be in place by April 12.
Annan's spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said Friday that a dozen UN observers are ready to enter Syria, where the ceasefire has been "relatively respected."
The advance team is "standing by to board planes and to get themselves on the ground as soon as possible," once the Security Council gives approval for the mission as hoped, Fawzi said. "We hope both sides (in Syria) will sustain this calm, this relative calm."
Yet Fawzi cautioned the truce is "only the beginning of a long road towards reconciling."
On Thursday, Annan said he was "encouraged" by reports that the cessation of hostilities in Syria "appears to be holding," urging all Syrians to seize the opportunity to implement the peace plan.
He also warned that the Syrian government has failed to implement key demands such as withdrawing troops and heavy weapons from cities and towns.
The UN-brokered truce went into effect at 6 a.m. Damascus time (0300 GMT) Thursday. Opposition activists later said the situation across Syria was calm in the hours following the deadline.
However, Syria accused the opposition of breaking the ceasefire, and its permanent representative to the UN cited eight attacks by the opposition in Syria on Thursday.
Syria's official media said "armed terrorists" assassinated an army major in the central Hama province on Friday, just hours after the killing of a brigadier in the capital Damascus.
Major Musa Yusuf was killed when two "terrorists" ambushed his car while he was en route to work, the state-run SANA news agency said.
Earlier on Friday, Brigadier Walid Joni was gunned down in his house in the Jaramana area in Damascus. Joni is the third senior officer to have been killed in three days.
SANA also said "terrorist groups" threw dynamite sticks at law-enforcement patrols in Sabunia neighborhood in Hama, causing no casualties.
In the northern Idlib province, authorities blocked an infiltration attempt by gunmen coming from Turkey's territories through Khirbet al-Jouz town in Idlib, SANA said, adding that some of the gunmen fled back to Turkey after the confrontation.
The incidents occurred as thousands of people staged anti-government rallies nationwide to call for Assad's downfall.
Activists said at least seven protesters were killed by government forces during Friday's protests.
The Syrian interior ministry stressed Thursday that staging protests is a lawful right, but requested citizens to obtain prior permission so that such events could be organized in an "orderly civilized manner."
The UN has estimated that more than 9,000 people, including at least 500 children, have been killed in Syria since protests broke out in March last year. Damascus said 6,044 have died, including 2,566 soldiers and policemen.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimated that a total of 43,610 Syrian citizens have become refugees throughout the region.
UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said Friday that humanitarian organizations need to obtain unhindered access into Syria as at least a million Syrians need urgent humanitarian aid.
"Even as the political and military situation evolves, the immediate priority for humanitarian organizations is to obtain unhindered access, especially to people in areas which have seen heavy fighting," Amos said in a statement.
She said it is "extremely important" that negotiations to enable humanitarian organizations in Syria to deliver aid remain separate from other efforts to resolve the crisis.
Amos also stressed the importance of being able to "make emergency humanitarian supplies and services available to people in a way that protects civilians and aid workers."
In Ankara, Turkish President Abdullah Gul on Friday pledged support for Annan's peace plan, saying that it was necessary to make good use of the peace process, and that it will be great for everyone if the process succeeds.
China said Friday it would continue to actively participate in the UN Security Council discussions on Syria.
"China supports any efforts conducive to stopping violence and promoting political dialogue in Syria," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Liu Weimin told a regular press conference.
"China actively supports the mediation work of Kofi Annan, and will make joint efforts with all the involved parties to maintain the cease-fire status in Syria," Liu said.
He said China hopes such efforts would help ease tension and promote political dialogue in Syria, so as to achieve a peaceful, just and appropriate settlement of the Syria issue at an early date. This should help to maintain peace and stability in the Middle East region.
