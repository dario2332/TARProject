  <text>A passenger train rammed into a freight train before dawn Tuesday in southern India, killing at least 15 people in a fiery wreck, officials said.
The freight train had been stopped at the station near Penukonda in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh state when the Hampi Express slammed into it. Four coaches of the passenger train derailed when the driver applied emergency brakes on seeing the freight train on the same track, said district official Durga Das.
One of the coaches caught fire, trapping many passengers in the coach. At least eight people were burned to death, said Charu Sinha, a top police official in Anantpur.
At least 35 people were injured and were in nearby hospitals, Sinha said.
Rescuers were trying to pull people out of the coaches. Sinha said at least 70 people had been rescued from the coaches that had derailed.
