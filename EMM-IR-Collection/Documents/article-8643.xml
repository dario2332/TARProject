The deadline for a ceasefire in strife-torn Syria has passed quietly without any immediate reports of breaches by either the Syrian government or rebel forces.
The ceasefire, which was set up by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, came into force at dawn and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was quiet in all regions.
People in the restive provinces of Homs, Hama and Idlib, which have seen sustained shelling by government forces in the past week, also said the situation was calm after the 6:00am (local time) deadline expired on Thursday.
An activist in Damascus said the capital was also quiet.
"It was a bloody night - there was heavy shelling on the city of Homs but now it is calm and there is no shooting," said an activist in Syria's third largest city, who called himself Abu Rami.
Just hours before the deadline expired, the military unleashed a lethal offensive against protest centres, killing 25 civilians including 10 in the rebel stronghold of Rastan, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Mr Rami said there was no indication that Syrian army forces were withdrawing from Homs in accordance with the ceasefire agreement.
"There are no signs of a pull back - the tanks, snipers and armed forces are still visible across the city," he said.
A few explosions had been heard in the town of Zabadani outside the capital Damascus shortly after the ceasefire deadline, but the cause was unclear and there had been no troop movements.
Mr Annan's plan calls for the withdrawal of forces from urban areas, a halt to fighting, a daily two-hour humanitarian truce, the release of arbitrarily detained people, freedom of movement for journalists and the right to demonstrate.
While Syria has told the Arab League it will comply with the ceasefire as long as opposition forces do the same, residents in some of the worst-hit cities are sceptical.
It's really terrible. It's really awful. At the moment everything is terrifying. The lack of food, the lack of medical supplement.
