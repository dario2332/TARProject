  <text>BEIRUT, Lebanon &amp;mdash; Despite the Syrian government's failure to send a "clear signal" that it will carry out a peace plan, the United Nations has proposed sending 300 cease-fire observers to Syria for at least three months &amp;mdash; with two high-level meetings about the crisis on Thursday that will focus on the mission.
Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations secretary-general, said in a letter to the Security Council that Syria had failed to implement almost every aspect of a peace plan.

In a letter to the Security Council assessing the situation on the ground since a cease-fire went into effect on April 12, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said Syria had failed to fulfill almost every aspect of a six-point peace plan.
In addition, the government of President Bashar al-Assad rejected a request by the advance party of United Nations observers to visit the beleaguered city of Homs, where activists said the government continued to shell residential neighborhoods harboring rebels on Thursday in violation of the cease-fire.
In New York, the United Nations Security Council is to discuss the viability of the observer mission, given the tension that has emerged with the Syrian government.
In Paris, foreign ministers from the Middle East and elsewhere, including the American secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, are expected to gather for a Friends of Syria meeting to discuss the peace plan and how to further pressure Damascus.
The Syrian government has signaled that it will restrict some aspects of the operation, which so far includes 8 observers out of an advance group of 30. In Beijing on Wednesday, Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, told a news conference that a maximum of 250 observers would be sufficient, and that if they needed air assets like helicopters they would have to rely on the Syrian military.
Mr. Moallem also said that the observers must come from "neutral" countries. He included on that list Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, which have either supported the Assad government or criticized United Nations attempts to isolate Syria. The United Nations regularly grants countries where its missions deploy approval over staff members' nationalities.
In spite of the differences, the two sides signed a preliminary agreement in Damascus on Thursday laying out the ground rules for the unarmed United Nations observer mission, Ahmad Fawzi, the spokesman for the special envoy Kofi Annan, said in a statement. Mr. Annan hammered out the peace plan under United Nations and Arab League auspices.
While acknowledging that stopping the violence from both sides was "the essential first step," the statement said, "the hard part lies ahead, a truly Syrian-led and -owned political dialogue to address the legitimate concerns and aspirations of the Syrian people."
The letter to the Security Council from Mr. Ban said, "Violent incidents and reports of casualties have escalated again in recent days, with reports of shelling of civilian areas and abuses by government forces."
It detailed a tense episode involving the observers on Wednesday during a visit to the Damascus suburb of Arbeen. The visit prompted a huge antigovernment demonstration that swamped the observers' two distinctive white vehicles. Activists said eight people were wounded by government troops who opened fire.
Videos posted on YouTube showed that a man on a loudspeaker whipped up the crowd with pointed questions about the government's adherence to the six-point peace plan.
"They have come to see whether the tanks have pulled out or not?" the man shouted, and the crowd roared back, "No!" People ducked for cover, and the United Nations vehicles left hurriedly after the first sharp bang of a gunshot. A pink sign attached to the back of one of the vehicles said: "The butcher continues killing. The observers continue observing and the people continue with their revolution."
The scene evoked this year's failed mission by Arab League peace observers, who were ill-equipped to deal with the violence erupting around them. Mr. Ban's letter said the cessation of violence by both sides was "incomplete." It said the Syrian government had failed to remove heavy weapons or troops from civilian areas &amp;mdash; the observers spotted an armored personnel carrier hidden under a plastic sheet during its visit to Arbeen and found a military presence there and elsewhere, including on an earlier visit to Dara'a, the southern city where the uprising erupted in March 2011.
