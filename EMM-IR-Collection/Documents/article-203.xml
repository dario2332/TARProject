The Arab League formally suspended Damascus this week over its crackdown  on an 8-month-old uprising, which the U.N. estimates has killed more  than 3,500 people. The group wants to send dozens of observers to the  country to try to help end the bloodshed.
Syrian activists said at least 11 people were killed as security forces  on Friday fired on anti-government protests. Friday has become the main  day for protests in Syria as thousands of people stream out of mosques  following afternoon prayers.
Ibrahim el-Zaafarani, a member of the Arab Medical Union who is expected  to be part of the observer team for Syria, said the mission will  include doctors, activists, lawyers and military experts.
The League originally had suggested a team of 500 people, but the number  dropped to 40. He said he was not clear on why or on whose behest the  number was reduced.
