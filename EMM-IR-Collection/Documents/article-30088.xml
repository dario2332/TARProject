  <text>BEIRUT, May 25 (Reuters) - Heavy clashes broke out on Friday between Syrian troops and rebel fighters in the town of Houla in Homs province, activists said.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 10 people were killed in shooting and shelling by Syrian troops on Houla, a cluster of four villages and towns north of Homs.
Activist Ahmad Kassem said the fighting erupted after Syrian forces opened fire on a demonstration against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad and killed one protester.
"There are casualties among the soldiers and five tanks have been destroyed," he said.
