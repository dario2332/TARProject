Protesters demanding that Egypt's army hand over power beat back a new police raid to evict them from Cairo's Tahrir Square.
Protesters demanding that Egypt's ruling generals hand over power have resisted a new police attempt to evict them from Cairo's central Tahrir Square.
Witnesses said police fired tear gas and attacked a makeshift field hospital, while protesters broke up pavements to hurl the chunks of concrete at police.
At least 22 people have been reported killed in clashes between government forces and protesters in Cairo and other cities since Saturday in some of the worst violence since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak.
Tahrir Square was the major rallying point for protesters in Cairo when an 18-day uprising toppled Mr Mubarak from three decades of power in February.
With just a week before voting in the first free parliamentary election in decades, the confrontations in the capital and other cities have raised worries about how smooth voting will be.
Egyptians elect a new parliament in a staggered vote that starts on 28 November.
However, even when the assembly is picked, presidential powers remain with the army until a presidential poll, which may not happen until late 2012 or early 2013.
Protesters want a much swifter transition.
Police backed by army officers fired salvoes of gas canisters and charged demonstrators in the square as darkness fell last night, temporarily sending protesters fleeing.
Demonstrators swiftly regrouped in side streets and returned to take control of the square overnight before police tried again to retake Tahrir after dawn.
