Council made clear in its statement that it won’t accept more
“broken promises” from Syria’s government about ending its
crackdown on the opposition.
“Today the Security Council has unanimously demanded that
the Syrian regime meet its commitment to pull back troops by

statement published on the ministry’s website.
