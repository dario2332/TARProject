Syrian forces have shelled two central districts in the battered city of Homs in the first bombings since a ceasefire took hold this week, a resident activist and human rights group says.
Homs resident Karm Abu Rabea said the army shelled the city throughout the night and into Saturday morning (local time), despite the government's agreement to Thursday's ceasefire.
"There was shelling last night in the old part of the city, in Jouret al-Shiyah and al-Qaradis. And I have heard eight shells fall in the past hour," Mr Abu Rabea, who lives in an adjecent neighbourhood, said.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said shelling had wounded several people overnight.
Further south, in the town of Dmeir, outside Damascus, security forces opened fire on a car, killing one civilian and wounding two, the Britain-based watchdog said.
The death came after six civilians were killed on Friday as tens of thousands marched across Syria, heeding calls by the opposition to take advantage of the UN-backed truce that went into force at dawn on Thursday.
The United States called for a vote at the UN Security Council after a second day of wrangling with Russia over security guarantees for the first 30 unarmed military monitors who UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan wants in Syria early next week.
Russia also opposed the council demanding that Mr Assad's regime carry out a promise to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns and cities.
Russia's UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he was not "completely satisfied" with the talks held at the UN on Friday. Russia and China have vetoed two previous Security Council resolutions on Syria.
Negotiations had been "rather difficult," he said, while insisting that Russia wants a vote on Saturday that allows the Syrian ceasefire to be "reinforced."
Neither the United States nor its allies are certain that the resolution would escape a new veto.
"It would be wise not to make predictions," said US ambassador Susan Rice.
"There was a negotiation, there is not yet an agreement," France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters.
"It's very tough, but there will be a vote tomorrow in any case."
A Security Council diplomat said: "A veto cannot be ruled out. It would be catastrophic for Syria if it happens."
A new version of the resolution drafted by the United States with Britain and France was sent to other council members late Friday for national governments to decide which way to vote.
Russia has also registered a shorter version of the draft for an eventual vote.
Both versions authorise the first 30 monitors in an observer force that would swell to more than 200 if the ceasefire firms up.
The UN says well over 9,000 people have been killed since the uprising against Mr Assad's regime erupted in March last year.
