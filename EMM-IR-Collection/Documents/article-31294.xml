  <text>Syria's foreign ministry has denied government troops were behind an attack on a string of villages that left more than 90 people dead.
The assault on Houla, an area north-west of the central city of Homs, was one of the bloodiest single events in Syria's uprising. The UN said 32 of the dead were under the age of 10.
The attacks sparked outrage from American and other international leaders, and renewed concerns about the relevance of a month-old international peace plan that has not stopped almost daily violence.
Foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said that Syria is being subjected to a "tsunami of lies" blaming the government. He said anti-government gunmen carried out the attack.
"We categorically deny the responsibility of government forces for the massacre," Mr Makdissi said.
He said a committee was sent to investigate the case and results should be out within three days. He added that UN envoy Kofi Annan will be in Syria on Monday.
Meanwhile, activists said Government troops shelled residential areas in central Syria.
The shelling hit neighbourhoods in the central city of Hama and the rebel-held town of Rastan, north of Homs, the Local Coordination Committees and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The two groups also reported clashes between troops and rebels in Hama, in the Damascus suburb of Harasta and in the capital's central Midan district. They said a bomb struck a security vehicle in the capital's district of Mazzeh - near a military airport.
The Observatory said the vehicle bombing caused casualties but did not have other details on the dead or wounded from the day's violence.
