  <text>April 16, 2012 (KUAJOK) - The governor of South Sudan’s Warrap state has officially directed the public to embark on a massive mobilisation to counter escalating insecurity, food and economic crises in the newly independent nation.
“Today as you know, we have challenges that need to be addressed,” Malek said, adding that “Unless we start mobilising and preparing our people now, it may be very difficult to address these challenges.”
The governor specifically cited internal and external insecurity as well as the recent austerity measures as some of the issues that require immediate redress.
The disputed area has been held by the SPLA for almost a week although unconfirmed reports say the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) have since reclaimed part of the area.
Much of the Abyei region has been occupied by SAF since May last year after a referendum due for January 2011 did not take place. Just as the SPLA claim there assault on Heglig was a response a SAF attack on Unity State, SAF say they took control of Abyei last year after one of their convoys was attacked heading north out of the area.
“When Sudan army occupied Abyei and displaced our people, the international community remained silent. Why are they now putting pressure on our forces who have the mandate to control South Sudan’s territory?” the Warrap State governor asked.
On Saturday, the youth in Warrap openly declared their intentions to embark on a voluntary mobilisation recruitment and sensitisation program as part of efforts to defend the country’s territorial integrity.
Morris Mabior, the initiative coordinator for the voluntary youth mobilisation, recruitment and sensitisation program said the one-month initiative will target all the six counties in the state. He hoped that all ‘Gelweng’ (cattle keepers) will join hands and work in collaboration with the state leadership.
South Sudan youth, according to the 2008 housing and population census, account for nearly 70 percent of the entire population.
Governor Malek also advocated for the establishment of a media, women and youth committee, which she identified as vital tools for effective mobilisation.
“Our media is not well developed, yet they play effective roles in society today. We need to strengthen our media so that the masses are informed. In the same way, the women and youth have to be empowered if they are to help in nation building,” she emphasised.

it is hopeless to keep preaching about war every single day,we see top leaders become warmongers instead of finding the solution for this senseless conflicts,Salva Kiir need to think beyond his narrow mind,he need to consult world leaders who got at least some experiences about wars between to nations.The war between two Nations is all very expensive and costy too,so lets look for the solutions.

Is this ok Omon Jr?
