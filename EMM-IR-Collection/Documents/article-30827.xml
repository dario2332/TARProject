The president underlined the importance of resolving this matter and releasing the abductees.
According to the NNA, 13 Lebanese Shia Muslims were kidnapped in Aleppo province on Tuesday as they were returning home by bus from a pilgrimage in Iran. Their families said that they were kidnapped by Syrian rebels. The Free Syrian Army, however, denied the accusation. The kidnapping took place amid heightened tension in Lebanon over the Syrian crisis.
