  <text>A US drone has fired two rockets targeting a house in N Waziristan on early Wednesday morning.
MIRANSHAH: At least four insurgents were killed in a US drone strike on a militant compound in a lawless tribal area in northwestern Pakistan on Wednesday, security officials said.
A local administration official and another intelligence official confirmed the early morning strike and casualties.
It also came a day after a NATO summit on Afghanistan concluded in Chicago.
In retaliation, a furious Islamabad closed the Pakistani-Afghan border to NATO supply trucks, ruling out the port of Karachi as a way to ship goods to the 130,000 US-led international troops fighting insurgents in Afghanistan.
The move has forced NATO to rely on longer, more expensive northern routes through Russia and Central Asia, even as it plans a large-scale withdrawal of combat troops and hardware from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
Deadlock over the blockade distracted from the NATO summit, even though US and Pakistani leaders expressed optimism that a deal will soon be reached.
US officials have so far rejected Pakistani proposals to charge several thousand dollars for each alliance truck crossing the border, and Washington also refuses to issue an explicit apology for the November air raid.
The frequency of the drone strikes has diminished in recent months, but US officials are believed to consider them too useful to stop altogether.
US President Barack Obama in January confirmed for the first time that US drones target militants on Pakistani soil, but American officials do not discuss details of the covert programme.
The New America Foundation think tank in Washington says drone strikes have killed between 1,715 and 2,680 people in Pakistan in the past eight years.
vey bad reporting ..are you 100% sure they were millitants?
may allah(swt)  grant jannah to departed ameen.may his curse be on americansRecommend
Ababeel is ever watchful.
Why not impose transit fees on drones ?
So, now PAK knows what was decided by US after the NATO conference. NATO supply route is a separate issue and drone is a separate issue is the US answer.
Washington considers it the main hub
  for Taliban and al Qaeda to plot
  attacks on the West and in
Why no one particularly our liberal secular class considers how these bunch of tribal people will attack west? I hope they do not mean attacking the west by just having Ak47s.
Is the American security so weak that they fear attacks from these people who merely are fighting for their lives,land and blood vengeance?
Excellent low cost option. Zero colatral damage this year.
How do you know that they were not militants? Perhaps you have done more research than the ET and have more connections with the targeted people that is why you are 100% sure that they were not militants and can challenge an organization like ET. This attack must hit the terrorist nerve center!
Double standards not only make you look the part of the fool, it also makes anything you say not really worth listening to. (e.g. your beloved sovereignty)
@y U no post me: This is a report by AFP not by tribune
The show is just beginning!
US message to Pakistan is loud and clear whether it opens the supply routes or not, drone attacks would continue regardless. If the stalemate continues, sanctions are on the cards which could cause more pain to Pakistan since the country is on the brink due to economic and internal security crisis.
What a brilliant idea, 10000 dollars per visit would be quite reasonable which US should agree.
Drones Targets not Islamabad / Karachi. Drones targets only where Pakistan lost sovereignty. Why crying?
This must be the best comment of the year 2012.
You are every creative with sense of humor.
