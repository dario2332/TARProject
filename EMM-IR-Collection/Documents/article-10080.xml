The UN Security Council has unanimously passed its first resolution on the Syria crisis, allowing an advance party of ceasefire monitors to go to the country on the brink of civil war. Russia and China, which had vetoed two previous resolutions on the 13-month old crisis, voted for Resolution 2042 while signaling there must be limits to international intervention in Syria. Following new government attacks in Syria, the United States and its allies in turn signaled "serious doubts" that President Bashar al-Assad will keep to a fragile ceasefire in place since Thursday. The resolution approved sending of the first 30 unarmed military monitors, who UN officials said could leave for Damascus within hours. Twenty-five monitors have already been identified and will leave as soon as flights can be organized, Britain's UN ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told reporters. The resolution also calls upon the Syrian government to "implement visibly" all commitments under special envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan -- including the withdrawal of all troops and heavy guns from Syrian cities. The 15-nation council said it would assess the implementation of the resolution and "consider further steps as appropriate." The leading powers had hoped for a vote Friday but this was held up by Russian objections to much of the text. Russia's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said "substantive changes" had been made to make it "more balanced." Russia and China had said two previous resolutions, which they blocked using their power of veto as permanent members of the council, were aimed at regime change. A new resolution with a full mandate will be required for the full monitoring mission of more than 200 observers. The resolution called on President Bashar al-Assad and the opposition "to guarantee the safety of the advance team" and its "freedom of movement and access." The Security Council ordered UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to report by Thursday on the initial work of the monitors and by Wednesday give recommendations for deploying the full mission.'Unimaginable brutality' US ambassador Susan Rice meanwhile said that new attacks Saturday by Syrian security forces, including shelling of rebel districts in Homs and firing on funeral mourners in Aleppo, raised "serious doubts" about Assad's commitment to the ceasefire. Other western envoys raised similar doubts. "The attacks suffered by the civilian population today in Homs confirm the doubts that one can have about the reality of the Syrian regime's engagement," said French envoy Gerard Araud. Araud said sending the advanced mission would "test whether Syria is serious about its engagements" before authorizing the full mission. The resolution comes "only after the Syrian people have over one year suffered unimaginable brutality at the hands of a regime which has prioritized its own survival," said Britain's UN envoy Mark Lyall Grant. Russia and China insisted that opposition groups must also keep to the ceasefire but say they are putting greater pressure on the Assad government. "We urge all parties, the Syrian government and opposition factions included, to strictly honor their commitments to cease all acts of violence and create the conditions to launch a Syrian-led inclusive political process," said China's envoy Li Baodong. "We need to guard against any attempt to create difficulties for Mr Annan's mediation. Any words or deeds which create obstacles to Annan's plan are not acceptable," he added.
