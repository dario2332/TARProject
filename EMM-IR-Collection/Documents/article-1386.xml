  <text>The chancellor of the University of California at Davis has ordered a task force to investigate the pepper spraying incident. NBC's Kristen Dahlgren reports.
SAN FRANCISCO - The president of the University of California system said he was "appalled" at images of protesters being doused with pepper spray and plans an assessment of law enforcement procedures on all 10 campuses, as two police officers were placed on administrative leave in the incident.
"Free speech is part of the DNA of this university, and non-violent protest has long been central to our history," UC President Mark G. Yudof said in a statement Sunday in response to the spraying of students sitting passively at UC Davis. "It is a value we must protect with vigilance."
Yudof said it was not his intention to "micromanage our campus police forces," but he said all 10 chancellors would convene soon for a discussion "about how to ensure proportional law enforcement response to non-violent protest."
Protesters from Occupy Sacramento planned to travel to nearby Davis on Monday for a noon rally in solidarity with the students, the group said in a statement.
Videos of UC Davis campus police firing pepper spray at apparently peaceful protesters on Friday illustrates the nationwide trend of police cracking down on demonstrators. NBC's Anne Thompson reports.
UC Davis officials refused to identify the two officers who were place on administrative leave but one was a veteran of many years on the force and the other "fairly new" to the department, the school's Police Chief Annette Spicuzza told The Associated Press. She would not elaborate further because of the pending probe.
Videos posted online of the incident clearly show one riot-gear clad officer dousing the line of protesters with spray as they sit with their arms intertwined. Spicuzza told the AP that the second officer was identified during an intense review of several videos.
"We really wanted to be diligent in our research, and during our viewing of multiple videos we discovered the second officer," Spicuzza said. "This is the right thing to do."
Both officers were trained in the use of pepper spray as department policy dictates, and both had been sprayed with it themselves during training, the chief noted.
Meanwhile, UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi said she has been inundated with reaction from alumni, students and faculty and would speed up an investigation that was to have taken three months.
"I spoke with students this weekend and I feel their outrage," Katehi said in a statement Sunday.
Katehi also set a 30-day deadline for her school's task force investigating the incident to issue its report. The task force, comprised of students, staff and faculty, will be chosen this week. She earlier had set a 90-day timetable.
She also plans to meet with demonstrators Monday at their general assembly, said her spokeswoman, Claudia Morain.
The UC Davis faculty association called for Katehi's resignation, saying in a Saturday letter there had been a "gross failure of leadership." Katehi has resisted calls for her to quit.
"I am deeply saddened that this happened on our campus, and as chancellor, I take full responsibility for the incident," Katehi said Sunday. "However, I pledge to take the actions needed to ensure that this does not happen again. I feel very sorry for the harm our students were subjected to and I vow to work tirelessly to make the campus a more welcoming and safe place."
The incident reverberated well beyond the university, with condemnations and defenses of police from elected officials and from the wider public on Facebook and Twitter.
"On its face, this is an outrageous action for police to methodically pepper spray passive demonstrators who were exercising their right to peacefully protest at UC Davis," Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg said in a statement Sunday. "Chancellor Katehi needs to immediately investigate, publically explain how this could happen and ensure that those responsible are held accountable."
The protest Friday was held in support of the overall Occupy Wall Street movement and in solidarity with protesters at the University of California, Berkeley who were jabbed by police with batons on Nov. 9.
Nine students hit by pepper spray were treated at the scene, two were taken to hospitals and later released, university officials said. Ten people were arrested.
Meanwhile Sunday, police in San Francisco, about 80 miles south of Davis, arrested six anti-Wall Street protesters and cleared about 12 tents erected in front of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Across the bay in Oakland, police made no arrests after protesters peacefully left a new encampment set up in defiance of city orders.

Do you think these morons went too far?  Gee, that's a hard question, duhhhh!!  Those pigs can thank God that none of these kids are mine or I would lose my religion and fight the evil that they are.  They are the kinds of people that cause revolutions!  That cause those that are sitting on their too comfortable butts to get up and do what they have to do to fight the evil that is now around us.  America thinks as long as all the protesters follow their rules, they won't get hurt.  That is not protesting!!!  People do not get permission to protest.  That is evil and insane!!  Did the people in Egypt and Libya get their governments permission for their protests??  Why did we back them and we are against the overthrow of our bad government?  Hypocrisy!  How is it a protest if you have ask permission?  People you had better take a long hard look at your country.
The video only shows very last part it does not show  them being asked to move off the side walk several times.   When you stop other people from using public property that is breaking the law  you get what you get when you refuse to follow the law.
Hague v. C.I.O., 307 U.S. 496 (1939), the high court ruled that peaceful demonstrators may not be prosecuted for "disorderly conduct." This case also secured streets and sidewalks as public forums.
Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963), in an 8-to-1 decision, the high court overturned the breach of peace convictions of 180 black students who had peacefully marched to the state capitol to protest discrimination. The police stopped the demonstration and arrested the students because they were afraid that the 200-300 who gathered to watch the demonstration might cause a riot. The court held the state law unconstitutionally over-broad because it penalized the exercise of free speech, peaceable assembly, and the right of petition for a redress of grievances. A disorderly crowd, or the fear of one, cannot be used to stop a peaceful demonstration or cancel the right of peaceable assembly.
CAROL, -----You had better take a long look in the mirror.
You want to protest and you don't want to ask permission..
What exactly do you think is going to happen?
The people in Egypt and Syria are putting their life and liberty on the line, and the whining losers in CA, are yelling police brutality for pepper spray.
Your post says every thing about you and the losers
The protesters should sue the university. This is an outrage! If that was done in Iran the American media would have been screaming foul at the top of their lungs - but when it happens here in US the response of the US media is muted.
If the protesters were warned before being sprayed, then I do not fault the police for their actions.   I am sure however that this incident would support the protesters cause...wait...forgot, they do not have one!
this is the cause, for the ill-informed...

The police are not supposed to use pepper spray at point blank range like this guy did!  His actions were completely sadistic.  He even raised their shirts to spray pepper spray directly on their skin!  These were students who were sitting peacefully and not threatening anyone!
FIRE THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR SPRAYING THE STUDENTS.
"The police are not supposed to use pepper spray at point blank range like this guy did!  His actions were completely sadistic."
That's exactly what I was thinking. He appeared to be enjoying his work too much. I think this police officer should be given a psychological test for sadism. Many sadists end up in jobs that require inflicting pain on others. There's no point in encouraging such a perversion. It's a good thing this was caught on video and broadcast all over the Internet. Otherwise, I don't think anything at all would have been done about it.
Here is a quote from Margaret Perry of the Daily Californian - the UC Berkeley campus newspaper.
I have emailed Lt. John Pike, the now infamous cop who begins to pepper-spray students at UC Davis to express my outrage. It's not enough, but I urge you to do the same at japikeiii@ucdavis.edu. The whole world is watching our campus police, and what it sees is disgusting.

It's interesting that the police and the media can't tell the difference between control and torture. What those policemen did on Friday was torture, pure and simple. They were under no threat. They  were not boxed in in a way they couldn't get out and they weren't trying to get the students to move.
What they were doing was inflicting physical pain on unarmed passive civilians in an attempt to inflict as much pain as necessary in the hopes that the victims would comply with their will. This is the biggest threat out there that day, that the students would not submit to authority, so the police chose to torture them until they did.
Does anyone think it strange that the police have developed no control mechanism that does not involv pain? Guns, batons, tazors, pepper spray, all induce various amounts of pain, all of which are essentually unbearable. Yet the police seem to get away with it every time.
The two officers involved were placed on administrative leave, per standard policy.  In English, that means they get a paid vacation with full benefits until they are quietly returned to work. We are supposed to believe that this is to protect their rights while an investigation is conducted. But what about the victims rights? They will be swept under the carpet too and no doubt some 'authority' will go on record pointing out that the victims weren't victims at all, they could have left before the incident started.
In reality, the police created the situation, as they often do, then 'took charge' when things broke down like they hoped it would.
If the authorities had their way, we would all stay at home and the world would appear to be a happy peaceful place and more crap can be dropped on everyone because there would be no news coverage at all and no reason for the police to go out torturing unarmed civilians.
Rodi Carsone Ask any police officer that you like. Pepper spray is be to used by law enforcement to repel an attack by another person or animal. These people were just sitting, and refused to move. They were attacking no one. I just wonder how long it is going to be, before we have another Kent State?
Should not the police be brought up on charges of assult?
What took so long?  I typically stand up for law enforcement but when that cocky bastard held up his can and started spraying these PEACEFUL protesters at point blank range, I was thankful he didn't have a cache of stun guns as he would have probably used those if given the chance.  And not one of his partners tried to stop him.  Makes me wonder if the command didn't come from the top.  Take all of those campus police that were close by the pepper spraying, out of control, cocky one, put them on unpaid leave and FIRE the cop that was doing all the spraying.  And then just sit back and wait for the lawsuits.  Oh, fire the top administration because they lead by example.
All that political posturing with the top administrators, you'd think they'd need to fill out a requisition form just to use the bathroom.
Finally the news isn't consumed with the OWS protesters. They lost their relevancy, legitimacy, and credibility when they interfered with others ability to go to work and interrupting the flow of commerce that we all need and want. Time to move on. They ruined any opportunity there might have been to get wide spread support. It is time these freeloaders got a job. If they devoted as much time to working as they do whining they might be able to be part of the 1%. How can they afford to be out there everyday anyway? Either they are getting handouts from the government, mommy and daddy are supporting them, or they are actually part of the 1% they say they despise.
FOX talking points should not be confused with reality.
Amen. I grow tired of them and still don't know what they want. I think they are upset some people have a lot of money and some people don't have much. Okay. It's only been that way for.... uhhh as long as man has organized himself into societies.  Grow up anybody?
That it, that is your best rejoinder?
