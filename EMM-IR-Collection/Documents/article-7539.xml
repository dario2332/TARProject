  <text>UNITED NATIONS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council on Tuesday underlined the need for the Syrian government and the armed opposition to meet the ceasefire deadline and fully implement a peace plan proposed by international envoy Kofi Annan for a peaceful solution to the year-long crisis in the Middle East country, Susan Rice, U.S. UN ambassador who holds the rotating council presidency for April, told reporters here.
Rice made the statement as she was speaking to reporters here after the 15-nation council met behind closed doors to discuss a letter to the council from Kofi Annan, the joint special envoy of the UN and Arab League for Syria.
"The members of the council reiterated the need to implement fully its presidential statements of March 21, and April 5," which supports Annan's proposed peace plan and ceasefire deadline in a bid to bring an early end to the Syrian crisis, which broke out in March 2011.
In his letter to the Security Council on Tuesday, Annan said that the Syrian government must send a political signal by achieving a cessation of its military operations in the coming days. He also called for a quick action by the UN Security Council to deploy "an effective international monitoring mechanisms" in Syria.
Rice, reading a press statement of the Security Council, said that the council members is strongly supporting Annan's plea to the Syrian government to halt all military operations and pull its troops out of cities to pave the way for a ceasefire to take place on April 12.
"The members of the council, therefore, echoed the Envoy's call to urge the opposition, also to fulfill their commitment to the six-point plan, and give no excuse to the government to renege on its commitment, and they noted clear declaration coming from the opposition, which the Envoy characterized as encouraging in this respect," Rice said.
If the Syrian government meets the April 10 deadline, the Syrian opposition should halt fighting 48 hours after the withdrawal of government forces, so all fighting in the country must stop by 6 a.m. Damascus time on April 12, Annan said last week while briefing the UN General Assembly.
Annan, who was appointed to mediate an early end to the year- long crisis in Syria on behalf of the United Nations and the Arab League, is expected to brief the Security Council on April 12, diplomats said here.
Annan's six-point plan calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons and troops from population centers, a daily halt in fighting for the delivery of humanitarian aid and treatment for the wounded, as well as talks between the government and opposition.
"The Syrian leadership should now seize the opportunity to make a fundamental change of course," Annan said in the letter. "It is essential that the next 48 hours bring visible signs of immediate and indisputable change in the military posture of the government forces throughout the country."
