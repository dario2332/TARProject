The UN Security Council has condemned "in the strongest possible terms" the killings of dozens of men, women, and children in a Syrian town.
The UN says at least 108 people were killed and 300 wounded in the May 25 attacks in Houla, near Homs.
The Security Council said in a statement issued after an emergency meeting on May 27 that the attacks "involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood."
The 15-nation Council also "condemned the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse" in Houla. It did not say who was responsible for these close-range attacks.
The statement said those responsible for the killings must be held accountable and demanded that President Bashar al-Assad withdraw heavy weapons from Syrian towns.
The Syrian government has blamed "terrorists" for the May 25 bloodshed, saying army tanks had not been in the area.
Speaking to journalists as he headed into the Security Council meeting, Alexander Pankin said: "There are substantial grounds to believe that the majority of those who were killed were either slashed, cut by knives, or executed at point blank distance."
He told broadcasters in London that Britain would lean on Russia to get Syria to implement the peace plan of international envoy Kofi Annan.
In April, the Syrian government and the opposition pledged to implement a six-point plan brokered by Annan, including a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from urban areas.
Annan is due to visit Damascus on Monday (May 29) to try to revive the plan.
The UN says at least 10,000 people have been killed since the uprising against Assad started in April 2011.
