The bomber, who was dressed in military uniform, apparently blew himself up in the middle of the battalion as they were rehearsing for a parade the following day.
The parade was being held to mark the 22nd anniversary of the unification of north and south Yemen and was due to be attended by Yemen's president, a military officlal said.
The attack was carried out at Sanaa's Sabeen Square where the government often holds large military events.
"There are (many) dead and the toll could rise," the military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The attack is the most deadly in Yemen since President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi took power in February with a pledge to fight al Qaeda's growing presence in the county.
