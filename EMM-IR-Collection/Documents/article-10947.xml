His plea came after prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh spent over an hour reading the 
  charges against him, including "acts of terror," and listing each 
  of his 77 victims and and how they died.
"I acknowledge the acts, but not criminal guilt and I claim self-defence," 
  he told the court on the first day of his 10-week trial.
The judge then entered the plea as "not guilty."
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit, smiled as a guard removed his handcuffs in 
  the crowded court room. The 33-year-old then flashed a closed-fist salute, 
  before shaking hands with prosecutors and court officials.
"I don't recognize Norwegian 
  courts because you get your mandate from the Norwegian political parties who 
  support multiculturalism," Breivik said in his first comments to the

Breivik also said he does not recognise the authority of Judge Wenche 
  Elisabeth Arntzen, because he said she is friends with the sister of former 
  Norwegian Prime Minister and Labor Party leader Gro Harlem Brundtland.
The anti-Muslim militant described himself as a writer, currently working from 
  prison, when asked by the judge for his employment status.
After opening statements Monday, Breivik is set to testify for five days, 
  explaining why he set off a bomb in downtown Oslo, killing eight, and then 
  shot to death 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labor Party youth camp on 
  Utoya island, outside the Norwegian capital.
Breivik has admitted to the attacks, claiming they were necessary to protect 
  Norway from being taken over by Muslims, but has rejected criminal guilt. He 
  claims he targeted the government headquarters in Oslo and the youth camp to 
  strike against the left-leaning political forces he blames for allowing 
  immigration in Norway.
Breivik remained stone-faced and motionless as prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh read 
  his indictment on terror and premeditated murder charges, including 
  descriptions of how each victim died.
The key issue to be resolved during the 10-week trial is the state of 
  Breivik's mental health, which will decide whether he is sent to prison or 
  to psychiatric care.
If deemed mentally competent, he would face a maximum prison sentence of 21 
  years or an alternate custody arrangement under which the sentence is 
  prolonged for as long as an inmate is deemed a danger to society.
Police sealed off the streets around the court building, where journalists, 
  survivors and relatives of victims watched the proceedings in a 200-seat 
  courtroom built specifically for the trial.
Thick glass partitions were put up to separate the defendant from victims and 
  their families, many of whom are worried that Breivik will use the trial to 
  promote his extremist political ideology. In a manifesto he published online 
  before the attacks, Breivik wrote that "patriotic resistance fighters" 
  should use trials "as a platform to further our cause."
Norway's NRK television will broadcast parts of the trial, but it is not 
  allowed to show Breivik's testimony.
Breivik told investigators he is a resistance fighter in a far-right militant 
  group modeled on the Knights Templar medieval crusaders, but police have 
  found no trace of the organization and say he acted alone.
Anxious to prove he is not insane, he has called right-wing extremists and 
  radical Islamists to testify during the trial, to show that there are others 
  who share his view of clashing civilizations.
Breivik surrendered to police 1 hour and 20 minutes after he arrived on Utoya. 
  The police response was slowed by a series of mishaps, including the lack of 
  an operating police helicopter and the breakdown of an overloaded boat 
  carrying a commando team to the island.
