  <text>Deaths: Syrian government troops appear to be surrounding three bodies of members of the Free Syrian Army who were killed by soldiers in the southern city of al-Karak
People contacted by telephone in the flashpoint provinces of Homs, Hama and Idlib, which have been under sustained shelling by Assad's forces over the past week, reported calm. An activist in Damascus said the capital was also quiet.   
'More than two hours have passed, and it's completely quiet across the country,' said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).    The Syrian government bars access to most independent media.   
Like activists in other cities, the man who uses the cover name Abu Rami said there was no indication troops were withdrawing from Homs in accordance with the agreement.   
'There are no signs of a pull-back; the tanks, snipers and armed forces are still visible across the city,' he said.   
China welcomed the ceasefire and urged the regime to fulfill its pledge to abide by a peace plan brokered by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it hopes the Syrian government continues to 'take concrete actions to support and cooperate with Annan's mediation efforts.'
Beijing has also called on Syria's armed opposition to observe a cease-fire and work toward a political settlement of the crisis.
China has joined Russia in blocking attempts by the U.S. and others at the United Nations to compel Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime to end violence against political opponents waging a 13-month uprising. That has drawn accusations that Beijing is providing cover for Assad, with whom it has long enjoyed friendly relations.
Western powers have pinned their hopes on Annan's plan, in part because they are running out of options. The U.N. has ruled out any military intervention of the type that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, and several rounds of sanctions and other attempts to isolate Assad have done little to stop the bloodshed.
