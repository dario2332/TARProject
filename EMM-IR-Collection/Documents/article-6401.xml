Syrian troops have shelled restive cities and villages and sent tanks and snipers into battle against rebels in the capital's suburbs less than a week before an internationally-sponsored ceasefire takes effect, according to activists.
With fighting escalating, the stream of Syrians fleeing to neighbouring Turkey has picked up considerably, as about one-third of the total of 24,000 refugees arrived in the past two weeks, Turkish officials said. Some 2,500 crossed the border on Thursday alone, the country's foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.
He told UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon his country would seek U.N. assistance if the influx continues. Turkey has in the past floated the idea of creating a small buffer zone inside Syria if refugee flows become overwhelming.
"These developments are seriously worrying us," Mr Davutoglu said of the intensifying violence.
The apparent trigger for the latest rush of refugees was an offensive by Syrian president Bashar Assad's forces this week near the town of Idlib, close to Turkey. Activists reported scores dead in the village of Taftanaz, and said another village nearby, Killi, was being shelled.
"They devastated Taftanaz, all houses demolished, everything destroyed," Hikmet Saban, a Syrian refugee who reached Turkey, told Turkey's state-run Anadolu agency. "Helicopters and tanks are bombarding continuously. Taftanaz has been burnt to the ground for three days."
Activists posted video they said showed a helicopter gunship firing a missile at Taftanaz and a local mosque hit by shelling.
Dozens of refugees, including a young man on crutches and a defector from the Syrian army in military camouflage, were huddled behind razor wire on the Syria-Turkey border Friday, waiting to cross into Turkey, according to footage shown on Turkey's state TV. Turkish soldiers registered their names before letting them in.
In Syria's central city of Homs, thick black smoke billowed from a residential area as the sounds of heavy gunfire and explosions could be heard. "Intense shelling by Assad's gangs," a man could be heard saying while filming what appeared to be a house on fire. "May God help us."
Regime forces also struck the town of Rastan, just north of Homs, with heavy machine-guns and mortars, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Ground troops later tried to push their way into the city, clashing with opposition fighters, the group said.
