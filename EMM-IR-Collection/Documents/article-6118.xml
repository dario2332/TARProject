Speaking by video link to Geneva, Mr Annan told a gathering of the UN in New 
  York that all fighting must end by 6am Damascus time on April 12, and urged 
  the government and opposition forces to get the message to "every 
  soldier" as he warned that the violence had not yet stopped on the 
"Let us stop the killing and start the serious political dialogue - the 
  transitional winds blowing today can not be resisted, at least not for long. 
  The only answers lead us to embrace reform."
A statement, in which the council "calls upon the Syrian government to 
  implement urgently and visibly its commitments" was adopted at a 
  meeting on Thursday, diplomats said.
The council said that depending on Annan's reports on what President Bashar 
  al-Assad has carried out, it will "consider further steps as appropriate".
The 15-nation council, which has been badly divided on Syria, gave its new 
  boost to Annan's peace mission just before the envoy briefed the UN General 
  Assembly on his efforts to halt the government clampdown which the UN says 
  has left more than 9,000 dead.
