  <text>World powers, fearful that Seif would not be given a fair trial after his father was felled by a bullet to the head after being captured exactly a month ago, are urging Libya to work with the ICC.
But the NTC insists that Seif will face trial at home.
On Saturday, the ICC said Libya must hand Seif over but held out the prospect of a trial in Tripoli.
ICC spokesman Fadi Al-Abdallah told AFP Libyan authorities were obliged to cooperate with the ICC and surrender him to the court as required by the UN resolution on Libya.
Ex-spy Senussi was captured in the south on Sunday, officials said.
The court issued warrants on June 27 against Seif, 39, Kadhafi and Senussi on charges of crimes against humanity.
He is also wanted in France where a Paris court sentenced him in absentia to life in 1999 over an attack on a French UTA airliner a decade earlier that killed 170 people.
Zintan military council chief Osama Juili said Seif would be held there until a new transitional government decides his fate.
The new government, which had been due to be announced on Sunday, has been delayed by 48 hours at the most, NTC vice chairman Abdel Hafiz Ghoga told reporters.
More details about his capture emerged on Sunday, with one Zintan brigade member expressing surprise at his courage.
Meanwhile, a four-day defence ministry conference on reorganising the national army began on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, cradle of the rebellion.
