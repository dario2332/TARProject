  <text>ANDERS Behring Breivik, the right-wing fanatic who confessed to killing 77 people in a bomb and shooting massacre in Norway has gone on trail.
Breivik smiled as a guard removed his handcuffs in the crowded courtroom in the capital, Oslo and defiantly rejected the authority of the court.
The 33-year-old then flashed a closed-fist salute, before shaking hands with prosecutors and court officials.
"I don't recognise Norwegian courts because you get your mandate from the Norwegian political parties who support multi-culturalism," Breivik said in his first comments to the court.
Breivik also said he did not recognise the authority of Judge Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen, because he said she is friends with the sister of former Norwegian prime minister and Labour Party leader Gro Harlem Brundtland.
The anti-Muslim militant described himself as a writer, currently working from prison, when asked by the judge for his employment status.
After opening statements today, Breivik is set to give evidence for five days, explaining why he set off a bomb in central Oslo, killing eight people, and then shot dead another 69 people, mostly teenagers, at a Labour Party youth camp on Utoya island, outside the Norwegian capital.
Breivik has admitted the attacks, claiming they were necessary to protect Norway from being taken over by Muslims, but has rejected criminal guilt. He is facing terrorism and premeditated murder charges.
The key issue to be resolved during the 10-week trial is the state of Breivik's mental health, which will decide whether he is sent to prison or to psychiatric care.
