  <text>The United Nations Security Council is due to vote later on a resolution to send in monitors to observe the ceasefire in Syria.
It comes after the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces shot dead two men in Hama while demonstrators were converging on a square, reports Sky News.
In the southern province of Deraa, a man was reportedly shot dead as worshippers left a mosque in the town of Nawa.
A fourth man was said to have been killed by security forces in the town of Salqeen in the north-western province of Idlib.
Syrian state media blamed two of the deaths on the opposition, saying an "armed terrorist group" shot dead the man in Salqeen and attributing the deaths of the Hama protesters to shots fired by fellow demonstrators.
It also said "terrorists" shot dead an army major as he drove to work at his army unit, saying armed groups were seeking to "destroy any effort to find a political solution to the crisis" in Syria.
But rallies videoed by activists were far smaller than previous large, chanting crowds seen in major cities since the uprising began 13 months ago.
The UN Security Council is expected to approve a resolution on Saturday that will authorise the deployment of an advance team of some 30 unarmed UN observers to Syria within days.
It is unclear how many additional monitors will be sent in the coming weeks, but diplomatic sources suggest as many as 500.
The terms of their deployment, along with guarantees of their freedom of movement in the country, are still being negotiated with the regime.
The UN will be keen to avoid a repeat of the Arab League monitoring mission which collapsed in failure when the observers were closely controlled by the Syrian government and largely kept away from areas worst affected by the violence.
Annan warned the situation is "fragile" but has been encouraged that the cessation in hostilities "appeared to be holding".
"There are detainees that need to be released, humanitarian corridors that need to be opened."
Western nations including the US, Britain and France, have expressed concern that the Syrian regime is already violating the deal by failing to withdraw its forces and heavy armour from towns and cities across the country.
