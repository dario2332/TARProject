  <text>International mediator Kofi Annan said Tuesday that the Syrian army had indicated it was pulling out of some areas but he had also received reports of troops moving into other parts of the country.
"They have indicated that there has been withdrawals... but we also received indications from other sources that there are movements towards areas which have not been previously targeted," Annan said at a press conference after visiting Syrian refugees in Turkish border camps.
Despite reports of continuing bloodshed, Annan however noted that his plan was "very much alive," as he noted that there was still time for all Syrian parties to abide by the plan he brokered until April 12.
"I again appeal to the Syrian government and the Syrian parties to cease violence in accordance [with] the plan and I believe there should be no preconditions for stopping violence," he added in an apparent reference to the lack of agreement between Syrian regime and rebels on how to end the violence.
Annan's visit came a day after shooting from Syrian side wounded six people on Turkish soil, a first incident of its kind that drastically increased tensions at Turkey's border with Syria.
