  <text>On Monday, an opposition group reported that the Syrian army's 
bombardment of the city of Hama has killed at least 41 people in the 
Syrian tanks and infantry fighting vehicles opened fire on several 
neighborhoods of Hama on Sunday after a series of attacks by rebel Free 
Syrian Army fighters on roadblocks and other positions manned by Assad's
 forces, opposition sources said.
The dead included five women and eight children, the Hama Revolution 
leadership Council said in a statement. The report could not be 
independently verified.
On Sunday, the United Nations unanimously condemned the killing of at 
least 108 people over the weekend, including many children, in Houla, a 
sign of mounting outrage at the massacre that the government and rebels 
blamed on each other.
Western and Arab states opposed to Assad put the blame for the deaths 
squarely on the government, but Damascus rejected the charge and blamed 
"armed terrorist groups" for the bloodshed.
China condemned the violence but stopped short of blaming Assad's forces for the killings.
Russia also decried the violence, but placed responsibility equally on 
both sides to the conflict. "We are dealing with a situation in which 
both sides evidently had a hand in the deaths of innocent people," 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a joint news conference 
with visiting British Foreign Secretary William Hague.
The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood called on "Arab, Islamic and international governments ... and the people of the free world to intervene to stop these massacres, especially after the failure of international forces and international monitoring to stop them," spokesman Mahmoud Ghozlan said in a statement.
Ghozlan also called on Syrians to put aside their differences and unite to "bring down the regime, make the revolution succeed and free the heroic Syrian people".
He said the Syrian government's crimes were worse than those of Genghis Khan, a warrior who founded the Mongol empire in the 13th century.
Iran said the killings had been carried out in order to spread chaos and instability in Syria and block peace efforts.
"We are certain that foreign interference, terrorist and suspicious measures which have targeted the resilient Syrian people are doomed to fail," the website of the state television network, Press TV, quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast as saying.
Iran's parliament blamed the United States and other Western countries for arming and training what it described as "terrorists", the Iranian state news agency reported on Monday.
