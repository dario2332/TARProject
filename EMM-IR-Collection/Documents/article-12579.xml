In all, officials said extremists launched 10 attacks in Baghdad and in northern Iraq, in Kirkuk, Samarra, Dibis and Taji. Additionally, mortars were fired into the northern cities of Beiji and Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, but no injuries were reported there.
At least 79 people were wounded in the rapid-fire explosions that unfolded over an hour and 15 minutes. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but Baghdad military command spokesman Col. Dhia al-Wakeel said they resembled those carried out by al Qaeda.
"They want to send a message that they can target the stability that has been achieved recently," Mr. al-Wakeel said. "This will not discourage our security forces."
The single deadliest bombing came in Dibis, located near Kirkuk, 180 miles north of Baghdad. Kirkuk Police Brig. Gen. Sarhad Qadir said a parked car exploded in the Sunni Arab village, killing six passersby and wounding four.
In Baghdad, police said roadside bombs and car explosions targeted security patrols and the nation's top health official, Health Minister Majeed Hamad Amin, as his convoy was driving him to work.
Mr. Amin, an Iraqi Kurd, wasn't hurt in the attack on his convoy in the capital's west, but two passersby were killed and six people were wounded.
Police and hospital officials confirmed the Baghdad casualties but spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information.
Five militiamen were killed and eight wounded in the suicide attack, according to local police and health officials. Violence in Samarra, a mostly Sunni city located 60 miles north of Baghdad, is particularly perilous because it is the site of a Shiite shrine that was bombed in 2006 in an attack that touched off a wave of sectarian clashes around Iraq, claiming thousands of lives and raising worries that Iraq was heading for civil war.
Additionally, two explosions in Kirkuk targeted a police patrol and the provincial investment official, killing three and wounding 21, Gen. Qadir said.
And a roadside bomb in the city of Taji, just north of Baghdad, exploded as a security patrol drove by. One bystander was killed and three policemen were among six people who were wounded.
The explosions ended nearly a month of quiet in Iraq, where violence waned since the run-up to the Arab League summit that was held in Baghdad at the end of March.
Overall, attacks have dropped sharply nationwide since Iraq threatened to dissolve into civil war five years ago. But bombings and deadly shootings are still common.
