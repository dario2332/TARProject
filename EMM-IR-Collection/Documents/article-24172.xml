  <text>Kataeb Party leader Amin Gemayel said on Sunday that the Lebanese army command’s investigation into the incident in which Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed was killed must be “accurate and transparent,” according to a statement issued by the Kataeb’s press office.
“It is important to strengthen the domestic arena… and not fall into traps set by Lebanon’s enemies,” he said.
Gemayel also warned of “violence,” and called on all political leaders to work to “prevent strife and restore stability in North [Lebanon] and all Lebanese areas.”
The statement added that Gemayel offered his condolences for the death of Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Merheb, was also killed. -NOW Lebanon
