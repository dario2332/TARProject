Beirut - Arab countries have pledged to arm Syrian rebels  fighting President Bashar al-Assad's forces, opposition activists  said on Monday.
'The Free Syrian Army will be armed by some friendly countries but  this will not be done in the open and will be very soon,' Sheikh Anas  Airout, a member of the Syrian National Council, told dpa.
'Arming the rebels is essential because if they do not, then this  regime will continue to kill the innocent people of Syria,' Sheikh  Airout said.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Libya are the key financial backers of the  plan to arm the Syrian rebels, an opposition source who requested  anonymity told dpa.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United States have pledged millions  of dollars at a Friends of the Syrian People conference in Istanbul  at the weekend to pay salaries for rebels fighting to topple al-Assad  and provide communications equipment.
The Syrian state-run al-Baath newspaper dismissed the conference  as a failure and said it 'showed no one is able to shake Syrians'  rejection of foreign intervention.'
An Arab diplomat in Beirut said that the international community  has still not 'fully' backed plans by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf  countries to arm the Syrian rebels because the fighters are still not  organized under one command.
The Arab diplomat said the pledge to pay and arm the rebels was  designed to encourage more high-ranking Syrian army officers to  defect.
Haytham al-Manaa, an opposition activists, said that 'sending  weapons to the opposition fighters now, will be a prelude to lead  Syria into a civil war.'
'The Syrian Free Army does not have a united decision, each  brigade works on its own,' al-Manaa said.
The poorly armed rebels have suffered heavy losses and lost  several strongholds to the Syrian army, forcing them to to retreat  as they could not face up to the better-armed Syrian army.
In the northern province of Idlib, two soldiers died in clashes  with rebel fighters near the Turkish border, the London-based Syrian  Observatory for Human rights said. It added that seven people were  also killed in shelling attacks by the Syrian army on the village  Haas, in Idlib.
There was also fighting in Daraa, near the border with Jordan.
Six people were killed when soldiers at an army checkpoint fired  at a car in the village of Kussair, near the Lebanese border,  activists based in the area told dpa.
In the capital Damascus, a bomb blast near a police headquarters  in Marjeh area wounded several policemen, the Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights said.
UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan will brief the UN Security  Council on recent visits to Russia and China, key Syria allies, and  the his efforts to implement a plan to end the violence.
Western and Arab nations on Sunday warned al-Assad to stop  delaying the adoption of the peace plan.
