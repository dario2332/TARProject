  <text>Salehi wants Assad to stay in power
Salehi said Iran wanted any changes in Syria to take place under the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad, for whose ouster Syrian pro-democracy protesters have been calling.
"Iran supports the people's will in Syria for more freedom, but also believes that any change should solely be done within talks between the people and the current government," Salehi said.
"We oppose any foreign interference in this regard and any calls for power change, and that is our difference with some regional and Western countries," Salehi added.
He also warned of a "power vacuum" in Syria if Assad were toppled from power and welcomed the fact that the peace plan did not call for Assad's removal.
Iranhas supported Assad's regime throughout the year-long anti-government protests. It, however, denies Western claims that it has supplied Syria with arms to help Damascus carry out its bloody crackdown on dissent.
Meanwhile, Syrian army troops have reportedly been continuing their assaults on protest hubs on Wednesday.
The Local Coordination Committees (LCC), an activist group, said explosions and heavy gunfire were heard in the early morning in the capital, Damascus, and in southern Daraa province.
The LCC also reported that shells and rockets were fired into Khaldiyeh and other parts of the flashpoint city of Homs in central Syria. At least seven civilians were killed in Homs on Tuesday as the deadline for army troops to withdraw from populations centers passed.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 52 people, including 28 civilians, were killed across the country on Tuesday alone. The deaths bring the toll since the weekend to at least 337.
The UN estimates that more than 9,000 people have been killed in violence since the uprising began 13 months ago.
