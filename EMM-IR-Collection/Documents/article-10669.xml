  <text>Grass has been denied entry to Israel because of a poem he wrote
"Why did they come to Israel, to the only real democracy in the Middle East? If they want to examine the issue of human rights, let them go to Syria," said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Actions condemned as excessive
Nine left-wing Israeli activists were also detained at Ben Gurion airport for carrying "Welcome to Palestine" banners.
Organizers condemned the actions as heavy-handed.
"We have shown that Israel pretends it is the only democracy in the Middle East," said Welcome to Palestine 2012 coordinator Abdul-Fatah Abu Srour.
Outside Israel, airlines cancelled the tickets of at least 300 passengers. At Brussels airport alone, some 100 French and Belgian nationals were denied boarding for flights with Brussels Airlines, Lufthansa and Swiss Air.
Several hundred activists protested at airports serving several European cities, including Paris and Geneva. Israel had issued a "blacklist" to airlines of known activists who would be refused entry.
The action comes a week after Israel banned German writer Günter Grass from visiting the country because of a poem he published declaring Israel to be a threat to world peace.
