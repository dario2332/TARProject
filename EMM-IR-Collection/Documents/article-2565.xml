  <text>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad denies that he has ordered a bloody crackdown of anti-government protesters and claims that police and security forces have taken the brunt of casualties in nine months of unrest.Assad's comments came in an exclusive interview in Damascus with ABC News' Barbara Walters.WATCH:  Interview excerpts."Most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government, not the vice versa," he tells Walters. The dead have included 1,100 soldiers and police, he said.While conceding that some members of his armed forces went too far, he claims they have been punished for their actions."Every 'brute reaction' was by an individual, not by an institution, that's what you have to know," he says. "There is a difference between having a policy to crackdown and between having some mistakes committed by some officials. There is a big difference," said Assad."But you have to give the order," says Walters."We don't kill our people… no government in the world kills its people, unless it's led by a crazy person," Assad responds.At another point he tells Walters, "There was no command to kill or be brutal."Syria has blamed the often violent uprising on criminals, religious extremists and terrorist sympathizers who have mixed in with peaceful demonstrators.The United Nations Commission on Human Rights issued a report last week that said that more than 4,000 people have been killed in the uprsing against the Assad regime.Assad dismissed the independent commission's report, saying: "Who said that the United Nations is a credible institution?"The 22-member Arab League has also condemned the crackdown and imposed economic sanctions on Damascus. Several European countries and the United States have also brought new sanctions to bear on the Assad government.Assad brushes off the new measures, saying, "We've been under sanctions for the last 30, 35 years. It's not something new."The Syrian president also tells Walters that he is instituting political reforms in his country, but says presidential elections, now set for 2014, cannot be rushed.Asked by Walters if the regrets the violence that has rocked his country in the wake of the Arab Spring movement that has spread across the Middle East, Assad says, "I did my best to protect my people.""I cannot feel guilty when you do your best. You feel sorry for the lives that have been lost. But you don't feel guilty when you don't kill people. So it's not about guilty."The interview will be broadcast today on several ABC programs and tonight on Nightline.
