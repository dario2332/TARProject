  <text>The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said
residents continued to flee the town, in central Homs
province, in fear that artillery fire would resume.
There was no immediate independent confirmation of the
accounts from Syria,
which has restricted access for journalists during a 14-month-old revolt
against President Bashar al-Assad.
Opposition activists said on Friday that Syrian forces
opened fire with artillery after skirmishing with insurgents in Houla, a
cluster of villages north of the city of Homs.
Various opposition activists put the death toll at over 50
by late on Friday. Footage posted to web sites showed bloodied and mangled
corpses described as the victims of the shelling.
