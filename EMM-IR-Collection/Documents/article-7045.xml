  <text>HOUSTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects in a shooting rampage that left three people dead and two others wounded in the U.S. state of Oklahoma appeared in court Monday and had their bond set in millions of U.S. dollars each.
Prosecutors will review whether hate crime charges are appropriate against the two white men, Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 32, for Friday's fatal shooting rampage in a predominantly black neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to a CNN report.
A judge on Monday ordered England and Watts held on more than 9 million dollars bond each after their arrest Sunday on first- degree murder and other charges. Their next court appearance was set for April 16.
Authorities have declined to say if they believe race played a role in the shootings, in which all the five victims are black. There are media reports that said revenge may be a factor in the killings.
The shooting death of England's father two year ago led to charges against a black man, according to Tulsa Police Captain Jonathan Brooks.
Police said that, based on Facebook postings attributed to England, a wish to avenge the death of his father might have been a factor.
Police acting on a tip arrested England and Watts on Sunday morning at a home north of Tulsa.
The dead in Friday's shootings were identified as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31. The two wounded men, who were not identified, were in critical condition but expected to survive.
All the victims were out walking or in a yard when the shootings happened, according to police. The victims appeared to have been chosen randomly.
The first shooting occurred at about 1 a.m. Friday, and the victim, Dannaer Fields, died at a hospital.
Three minutes later, two other people were shot near the suspect's vehicle. Those two victims were critically wounded but expected to survive, authorities said.
Another person was shot dead before 2 a.m. Friday. And the body of a third person killed was found at around 8 a.m. next to a funeral home, according to police.
