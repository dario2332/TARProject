Eight members of a family have been killed in an airstrike by the US-led NATO coalition in eastern Afghanistan, according to Afghan authorities.
The coalition says it is aware of the allegation and is looking into what happened late on Saturday in Paktia province.
Provincial spokesman Rohullah Samon said on Sunday that a man, woman and their six children were killed in a coalition airstrike about 8pm in Suri Khail village of Gurda Saria district.
Actions of the Taliban kill more civilians than foreign forces, but the deaths of citizens caught in the crossfire of the decade-long war continue to be an irritant in President Hamid Karzai's relationship with his international partners.
