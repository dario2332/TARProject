  <text>Cabinet spokesman Mohammed Hegazy said the resignation had not yet been accepted by the military council.
More than 20 people have been killed and nearly 1,800 injured in three days of violence in the Egyptian capital.
Egyptian activist groups have been demanding the military council hand power to a civilian government.
"The government of Prime Minister Essam Sharaf has handed its resignation to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces," cabinet spokesman Mohammed Hegazy said in a statement carried by the official Mena news agency.
"Owing to the difficult circumstances the country is going through, the government will continue working."
The biggest criticism in recent days has been that the military has taken too much power for itself, he adds.
A military source told Reuters that the council was seeking agreement on a new prime minister before it accepted the resignation.
As night fell in Cairo, thousands more flocked to the symbolic square - the focal point of protests that overthrew Hosni Mubarak in February.
Elections are due to begin across Egypt next week but many Egyptians fear the military plans to hold on to the reins of power, whatever the outcome.
Late on Monday, a coalition of political groups - including followers of opposition figure Mohamed El Baradei - accused the military council of leading a "counter-revolution".
They called for a mass demonstration in Tahrir Square on Tuesday.
We should not have left the streets. We handed power to the military on a silver platter,"
They also demanded a presidential election be held by April 2012.
Earlier on Monday protesters set up burning barricades in and around the square and threw stones at riot police and troops.
Security forces responded with batons, tear gas and birdshot. Ambulances raced through the crowds ferrying the injured to hospital.
Officials confirmed on Monday that more than 20 people had been killed and about 1,800 injured since Saturday.
One of the protesters in Cairo, Ahmed Imam, 33, said handing power to the military after the overthrow of Mr Mubarak had been a mistake.
"We should not have left the streets. We handed power to the military on a silver platter," he said.
"The revolutionaries went home too soon. We collected the spoils and left before the battle was over."
In other developments
Trouble started on Saturday after demonstrations against proposed constitutional changes unveiled by the interim government.
The military council produced a draft document setting out principles for a new constitution, under which the military and its budget could be exempted from civilian oversight.
A proposal by the military to delay the presidential election until late 2012 or early 2013 has further angered the opposition.
Protesters want the presidential vote to take place after parliamentary elections, which begin on 28 November and will be staggered over the next three months.
"Excessive force" was used by security forces in Bahrain against pro-democracy protesters earlier this year, the government finds.
