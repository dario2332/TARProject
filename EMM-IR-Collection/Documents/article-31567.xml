  <text>UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Sunday afternoon to hear a briefing from the head of the U.N. observer mission in Syria on the massacre in the town of Houla, with Russia questioning whether Syrian tanks and artillery were responsible.
Mood said in a statement Saturday that U.N. military and civilian observers who went to Houla counted more than 32 children under the age of 10 and over 60 adults among the dead. He said the observers confirmed from examination of ordnance found at the scene that artillery and tank shells were fired.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor Kofi Annan, who is serving as the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria, issued a joint statement condemning the "indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force" in violation of international law and Syrian commitments to stop using heavy weapons in populated areas. They demanded that the Syrian government stop using such weapons.
The Syrian government on Sunday denied responsibility for the Houla massacre, blaming the killings on "hundreds of heavily armed gunmen" who also attacked soldiers in the area.
"We have to establish whether it was Syrian authorities ... before we agree on something," he said.
Activists from Houla said Saturday that regime forces had peppered the area with mortar shells after large demonstrations against the regime on Friday. That evening, they said, pro-regime fighters known as shabiha stormed the villages, gunning down men in the streets and stabbing women and children in their homes
Both Pankin and Grant said the attack represents a violation of international law regardless of who is responsible.
The Houla attacks have sparked outrage from American and other international leaders, and renewed concerns about the relevance of a 6-week-old international peace plan negotiated by Annan that has not stopped almost daily violence despite the presence of more than 250 U.N. observers. The U.N. put the death toll weeks ago at more than 9,000. Hundreds have been killed since.
