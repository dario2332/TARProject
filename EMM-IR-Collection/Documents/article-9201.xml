  <text>International envoy Kofi Annan said Thursday that Syria has not adhered to his peace plan and called on the UN Security Council to demand that troops are pulled out of cities despite a fragile ceasefire.
The Security Council is expected to quickly start work on a resolution backing Annan and approving the deployment of UN observers to Syria, diplomats said.
Annan said before briefing the council that he was "encouraged" by the cessation of hostilities which started on Thursday.
He said the truce appeared to be holding, Syria was "relatively calm" and "apparently experiencing a rare moment of calm on the ground." The UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed in Syria in the past 13 months.
Annan added, however, that the Syrian government must carry out all six points of the peace plan he agreed with President Bashar al-Assad -- including a withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from cities.
"All parties have obligations to implement fully the six-point plan. This includes both the military provisions of the plan and the commitment to move to a political process," he said.
Annan told the Security Council that Assad had not complied with all parts of his plan and the council should demand that troops are pulled back to their barracks, according to diplomats at the closed meeting where Annan spoke by video-link from Geneva.
Annan also asked the 15-nation council to authorize the quick deployment of an observer mission to Syria, diplomats said.
The UN plan is for a small initial force to be sent followed by reinforcements so that Annan's peace plan can be fully monitored.
Annan said in his statement before the meeting that an observer mission would "allow us to move quickly to launch a serious dialogue that will address the concerns and aspirations of the Syrian people."
Any deployment of a UN mission requires a Security Council resolution. Russia and China have vetoed the two attempts so far to pass resolutions on the crisis in Syria.
