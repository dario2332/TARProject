  <text>Deeply shocked by the bloodshed, some Yemenis lashed out at Saleh, suspecting that his associates had a hand in the violence.
Sitting behind a bulletproof glass shield, Hadi was joined by top military commanders, government officials and foreign diplomats.
Ninety-six soldiers were killed and at least 200 wounded in what was one of the deadliest attacks in the capital in years.
Addressing the crowd Tuesday, the chief of staff of the Yemeni military, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Ali al-Ashwal, vowed the nation would not back down in the face of such attacks.
"We will not let terrorism destroy our future and dreams," he said.
Al-Ashwal was the only official to speak at the short ceremony. The parade was cut from three hours to one, a fly-over by fighter jets was canceled and only cadets from the police and aviation academies participated in the program.
Despite their grief, Yemenis for the first time marked the National Day without Saleh, who held power for nearly three decades before his ouster this year.
Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, was the site of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. There have also been a spate of assaults on the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, including a 2008 bombing that killed 10 Yemeni guards and four civilians.
