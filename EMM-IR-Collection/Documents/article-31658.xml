Syrian bloodshed: 90 killed, many children
Syria's government denies killing at least 109 people in Houla on Friday as protesters take to the streets.
The UN Security Council has held an emergency meeting on the situation in Syria, hearing that the toll from a massacre in the town of Houla has risen to 108 dead and 300 injured.

"We need to establish whether it was the Syrian authorities," Igor Pankin told reporters at the United Nations on Sunday, closing ranks with a key Middle Eastern ally as Damascus continued to deny its forces were responsible.
"There are substantial grounds to believe that the majority of those who were killed were either slashed, cut by knives, or executed at point-blank distance."

Major General Mood, a Norwegian, briefed the Security Council as UN and Arab League peace envoy Kofi Annan was expected to fly to Damascus on Monday to try to rescue his six-point peace plan amid a crumbling ineffective truce.
Major General Mood said the deaths were from "shrapnel" and gunfire at "point-blank" range, diplomats at the closed-door meeting at the United Nations in New York said.
"The investigation indicates that first there was the artillery barrage and then militia fighters moved into Houla," a UN source said.
But Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad al-Makdissi insisted the regime was "not at all" to blame for the massacre in Houla in central Homs province.
Blaming "terrorists" for the killings, Makdissi said Damascus had opened an investigation, with results expected within three days.
"Not one Syrian tank went in," he said.
Exiled opposition head Burhan Ghalioun on Sunday called for a "battle of liberation" against the regime until the United Nations takes action under Chapter VII allowing military intervention.
Despite the outcry, violence raged on, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reported at least 28 people killed across the country on Sunday, among them women and children.
