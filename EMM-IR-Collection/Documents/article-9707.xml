  <text>Will the alleged shell attacks in Homs heighten the stakes at the UN Security Council meeting?
The resolution, drafted by the United States and co-sponsored by Britain, France, Germany, Portugal and Morocco, seeks to put up to 30 unarmed UN observers on the ground to see that "a full cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties" was actually taking place in Syria.
Russia, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, was not completely satisfied with the draft resolution, leaving open the possibility that it would not be adopted following Saturday's scheduled vote.
"We need to cut off all the things which are not really necessary for this particular purpose," said Russia's UN ambassador," Vitaly Churkin.
Russia, along with China, has previously vetoed two Secuirty Council resolutions on Syria, but both countries are on board international envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria. The cease-fire, which was implemented Thursday, is part of the plan.
UN diplomats indicated that Russia's vote could go either way.
"It would be wise not to make predictions," said US ambassador Susan Rice. "We have been to this movie so many times."
Russia also put up a draft resolution that is similar to the US version, but eliminates the demand for "unimpeded" access for international observers and does not include language condemning human rights abuses in Syria or threats of further steps by the Security Council. The US version of the draft contains these clauses and is the only version currently scheduled for a vote.
Meanwhile, Syrians took to the streets across the country in demonstrations after Friday prayers, responding to opposition calls to take advantage of the UN-backed cease-fire.
Security forces were reported to have been out in force, at times using gunfire to block major protests from taking place, but refrained from wide-scale shelling or other actions that would violate the truce. Activists said they killed five protesters.
Opposition members estimated that tens of thousands took part in the nationwide protests.

EU officials say talks between Western powers along with Russia and China, and Iran over the latter's nuclear program have started in a "positive atmosphere." But general expectations are low.
German authorities say the provocative distribution of millions of copies of the Koran by an ultraconservative Muslim group over the weekend is legal, but will be carefully watched due to the possibility of violence.
Nico Rosberg of Germany earned the first pole position of his career on Saturday and gave Mercedes its first start from the front since 2010, with the fastest qualifying time for Sunday's Chinese Formula One Grand Prix.
Syrian forces have shelled the city of Homs, breaking the cease-fire that has been in place since Thursday, according to sources. The allegations come as the UN votes on a resolution to send in international observers.
