CAIRO: Egyptian soldiers and police set fire to protesters' tents in the middle of Cairo's Tahrir Square and fired tear gas and rubber bullets in a major assault yesterday to drive out thousands demanding that the military rulers quickly transfer power to a civilian government. At least four protesters were killed.
It was the second day of clashes marking a sharp escalation of tensions on Egypt's streets a week before the first elections since the removal of Hosni Mubarak from power in February. The military took over the country, promising a swift transition to civilian rule. But the pro-democracy protesters who led the uprising have grown increasingly angry with the ruling generals, and suspect they are trying to cling to power even after an elected parliament is seated and a new president is voted in.
The military-backed Cabinet said elections set to begin on November 28 would take place on time and thanked the police for their "restraint," language that is likely to enrage the protesters even more.
"The government is committed to holding elections on time," the cabinet said in a statement read out on state television.
The government said the police did not use live ammunition against protesters and thanked officers for "self-restraint in dealing with the events".
Televised footage showed military and state security police using tear gas and batons to disperse a protest.
Two protesters were killed on Saturday, bringing the toll for two days of violence to six. The clashes were some of the worst since the uprising ended on February 11.
They were also one of only a few violent confrontations to involve the police since the uprising. The black-clad police were a hated symbol of Mubarak's regime and after the uprising, they have largely stayed in the background while the military took charge of security.
