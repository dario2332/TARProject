  <text>The violence in Syria cannot be averted by means of traditional observers, believes UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. Therefore the UN is preparing a peace-keeping mission with a “broad and flexible mandate” to ensure the conflict ends April 12.
­“What we would need on the ground is a small nimble United Nations presence,” Annan announced during a video-conference briefing from Geneva.
He  further told the UN General Assembly that this force would need to be  deployed quickly with a broad and flexible mandate, with its freedom of  movement throughout the country and security assured. Annan said it  should engage all relevant parties and “constantly and rapidly observe, establish and assess facts and conditions on the ground in an objective manner.”
“We need to keep the unique character of the Syrian crisis in mind,” Kofi Annan stressed, adding that the violence in Syria “cannot be averted through the means of the traditional observer mission interposed between two armies.”
The idea of sending an effective UN supervision mission to keep the  peace was supported in full by the UNSC and both sides of the conflict  in Syria, Annan said.
Syria’s government welcomed the arrival of an advance UN team led by  Norwegian Major-General Robert Mood on Thursday. Their mission is to  prepare the potential deployment of observers.
A spokesman for Kofi Annan, Ahmad Fawzi, confirmed the arrival and  said the UN is already asking members to contribute some 250 soldiers to  monitor a ceasefire.
­Annan said he is aware that the Syrian government is partially  withdrawing troops from populated areas, particularly the cities of  Deraa, Idlib und Sabadani, in order to comply with his six-point peace  plan.
If the April 10 deadline earlier adopted by the Syrian government is  met, then all opposition fighters should stop their operations within 48  hours of the deadline – by 6 am local time on April 12.
“All interlocutors with whom we have spoken have committed to call  for the cessation of violence once the Syrian government has  demonstrably fulfilled its commitments,” Annan said.
The Syrian government is also taking certain steps towards  implementing other points of the peace plan, besides the ceasefire. Over  the last few weeks, some 21 European, Russian, Korean, and US  journalists have been granted visas to Syria. The government is also  planning to release detainees within a few weeks of the ceasefire and,  according to the ICRC head, provide access to detention facilities  throughout the country.
The Syrian government has indicated that it is going to update the  peace envoy on the situation, but Annan said that it is not enough and  “more far reaching action is urgently required.”
Meanwhile, reports of casualties keep coming from Syria. UN Secretary  General Ban Ki-moon expressed anxiety over the ongoing violence, saying  that the attacks on areas inhabited by civilians have not stopped,  despite the “acceptance of Annan’s peace plan on the part of the Syrian government.”
Activists claim that on Thursday Syrian troops launched heavy assaults on populated areas across the country.
“We are increasing our efforts to have an objective understanding of what is happening on the ground and who is doing what,” Kofi Annan said. “And I would welcome support in this endeavor from those with the influence and capacity.”
Violence has forced thousands to flee the country over the last year. Just over the last few days, more than 1,600 refugees have arrived in neighboring Turkey, according to the country's disaster management agency.
Reaching a truce is the keystone of the Annan’s peace plan to stop the bloodshed that has claimed over 9,000 lives since last March.
The US Coast Guard is to sink the Japanese “ghost ship” cast adrift by last year's massive tsunami, and which is now nearing the shores of Alaska.
WTF! What's going on here? Is Kofi Annan backtracking? He sounded like Ban-Ki-Moon for a moment. What does a, 'broad and flexible mandate?' even mean? 
It's as if Annan's had a rethink and has come to the conclusion that it's all the Syrian govt's fault. Whoever's whispering in his ear is playing fast and loose with the agreement that was reached. I don't recall any mention of this force. Perhaps someone's hoping that President Assad will, rightly in my view, decline to order all forces back to barracks whilst armed insurgents remain on the street.
I don't think this was the spirit of the deal that was reached and I'm afraid I see the ugly visage of Mrs Clinton and Susan Rice under the bed.
