Moscow, April 10, IRNA -- Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said on Tuesday that the Syrian government has pulled back troops from cities in line with a UN-backed peace plan to end armed conflict in the country.
Moallem told a press conference after meeting his Russian counterpart that the Syrian government fulfilled its obligation toward the ceasefire brokered by UN special envoy on Syria Kofi Annan.
He called for presence of international observers in Syria to monitor implementation of a ceasefire with the armed groups.
"We have already withdrawn forces and army units from several Syrian provinces,'' Moallem said.
'An end to violence must be simultaneous with the arrival of the international observers.'
Annan's six-point peace plan required Syrian forces to pull back from protest centres by Tuesday.
Moallem said his government wanted guarantees from Annan that the armed opposition groups would honor the ceasefire.
'We will not ask the terrorist groups, which are killing, kidnapping and destroying infrastructure, for guarantees,' he said.
'We want Annan to give us these guarantees.'
