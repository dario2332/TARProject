British Prime Minister David Cameron has accused the Syrian President of cynically exploiting the time spent on diplomatic negotiations to crack down even harder on his own people.
Mr Cameron said the flood of refugees fleeing to Turkey to escape the fighting was threatening regional peace and security.
Meanwhile, Syrian forces have reportedly continued to pound protest hubs today, despite mounting pressure from world powers.
Peace envoy Kofi Annan has said there is still a chance to salvage his plan to halt hostilities within hours.
Mr Annan rejected calls to arm rebels, saying such a move would be "disastrous".
Regime forces killed at least three civilians in a new wave of shelling and raids targeting the flashpoint city of Homs and other parts of the country, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Activist group the Local Coordination Committees said explosions and heavy gunfire were heard in Damascus and southern Deraa province.
Shells and rockets were fired into Khaldiyeh, a stronghold for regime opponents who have taken up arms, as well as other parts of Homs, the Observatory and LCC reported.
Reports from Syria cannot be independently verified as the government has barred international journalists and rights groups.
On the northern border, shots fired by Syrian forces struck a Syrian refugee camp inside Turkey, Turkish media reported, two days after shooting from Syria wounded four Syrians and two Turks on Turkish soil.
Mr Annan, speaking in Iran, said however that the situation should be "much improved" by tomorrow's ceasefire deadline if both sides respect his six-point peace plan.
"If everyone respects, I think by 6am (4am Irish time) on Thursday the 12th... we should see a much improved situation on the ground," said the UN-Arab League envoy.
Damascus had given "further clarifications" over how it would implement its side of the plan, he said.
"What they mean and want is an assurance that the other forces, the opposition forces, would also stop the fighting so that we could see cessation of all the violence," he said.
Mr Annan said his team has "had positive answers from them" and that "governments with influence" had also been approached to ensure all sides respect the ceasefire.
Turkey, a one-time ally of the Damascus regime, has called for Mr Assad to step down to resolve the bloodshed that has killed more than 9,000 people since it started a year ago, according to UN estimates.
