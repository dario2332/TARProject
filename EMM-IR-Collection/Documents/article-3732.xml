  <text>Also Monday, a civilian was killed in an explosion in the northern city of Aleppo, it said.
In Daraa, cradle of the uprising, forces carried out arrest raids in the town of Dael, where two houses were burnt and a third collapsed, said the Observatory and the LCC.
In the same region, army deserters fired rocket-propelled grenades at checkpoints at Inkhel, killing two soldiers, while gunfire was heard in the Tafas village.
Heavy machinegun fire was heard in the Hamidiyeh and Souk al-Hashish neighborhoods of Homs city, one of the main targets of the regime’s year-long crackdown, said the LCC.
A gun battle was fought between rebel fighters and government forces in the central city’s Juret al-Shiyah district, said the Observatory.
In Damascus, a blast ripped through the city center near a hotel and a police station, injuring some people and damaging shops, official Syrian television Al-Ikhbariya and witnesses said.
“A bomb exploded loudly near the Hotel Kinda” in busy Marja neighborhood in the center of the capital, the television said.
“Four people were slightly hurt and shops damaged,” it added.
Witnesses said the explosion occurred near a police station in Marja and that the area had been cordoned off by security forces. Ambulances were seen at the site of the blast.
Bombings have hit Syria’s major cities in recent months, provoking mounting concern that Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.
The latest violence comes a day after Western and Arab nations called for Assad to be given a deadline to meet the terms of a peace plan crafted by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
On Sunday, at least 40 people were killed in firefights across the country, among them 15 members of the security forces, the Observatory said.
According to U.N. estimates, more than 9,000 people have died in the regime’s crackdown on an uprising that began in March last year, inspired by Arab Spring protests that toppled long-time dictators in Tunisia and Egypt.
Meanwhile, reports that a Russian navy destroyer will dock at the Syrian port of Tartus in the coming days were revealed on Monday.
The Smetlivy guided-missile destroyer sailed for the Mediterranean from its Black Sea base of Sevastopol over the weekend and will shortly arrive at the Russian-leased port in Syria, state news agency and other reports said.
The ship will take on new supplies of food and water before conducting planned exercises near Syria’s coast, navy officials said.
“This will be a purely technical port call that is conducted by almost all Russian navy ships conducting exercises in the Mediterranean,” a senior source in the Russian navy told Interfax.
The source said the destroyer’s crew would not be leaving the ship while it was docked.
Tartus is the only base used by Russia in the Mediterranean.
Russia is a close Syria ally that had for the past years shielded President Bashar al-Assad from Western criticism for its bloody political crackdown that the United Nations says has killed more than 9,000 people.
A Russian ship reportedly delivered a supply of arms to Damascus through the same port in January.
