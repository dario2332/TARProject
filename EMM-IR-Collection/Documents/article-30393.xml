  <text>BEIRUT, May 26, 2012 (AFP) -Syrian regime forces have "massacred" more  than 90 people, including 25 children, in the town of Houla, the Syrian  Observatory for Human Rights said on Saturday.
Deadly shelling on Friday continued late into the night, the Observatory's Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.
"Many  people are fleeing Taldau village in Houla," the Observatory said,  adding that residents feared new attacks on the town, in the central  province of Homs.
Regime forces pounded the edges of Houla on Friday,  Abdel Rahman said, adding that this caused residents of the town's  outskirts to flee towards the centre.
Amateur videos posted on  YouTube showed horrifying images of children lying dead on the floor,  with some of their corpses badly mangled. At least one child had had  part of his head blown off.
The Britain-based watchdog condemned the  Arab and international communities, describing them as "complicit with  the Syrian regime in the Houla massacre."
The international community was "silent in the face of the massacres committed by the Syrian regime," it said.
Earlier,  the opposition Syrian National Council urged the UN Security Council to  act after regime forces "massacred" what it said was more than 110  people in Houla.
The latest flare-up of violence came as Kofi Annan,  the UN-Arab League envoy to Syria who brokered a repeatedly violated  ceasefire last month, finalised plans to return to Damascus.
