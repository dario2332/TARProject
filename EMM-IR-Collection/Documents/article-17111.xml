European Union foreign ministers have agreed fresh sanctions against Syria and warned of more action to come if the regime fails to abide by a ceasefire.
The measures include an assets freeze and visa ban on two firms and three people believed to provide funding for the regime.
The country is still engulfed in violence after 14 months of protests.
Ministers also urged a quick deployment of ceasefire observers under the peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, which the EU sees as the only possible way to avoid all-out civil war in Syria.
