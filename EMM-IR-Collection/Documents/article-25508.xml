  <text>Elliot Turner found guilty of murder, and his parents are convicted of trying to cover up crime
A wealthy jeweller's son has been found guilty of murdering his 17-year-old girlfriend in a jealous rage.
Elliot Turner, 20, part of a gang of rich young men who called themselves The Firm, strangled 17-year-old Emily Longley in his bed after becoming suspicious that she was seeing other men.
Turner's parents Leigh, 54, and Anita, 51, tried cover up the crime by destroying a confession note from their son after the killing at their home in Bournemouth, Dorset, in May last year. They were convicted of perverting the course of justice.
Turner was convicted following nine hours of deliberations by a jury at Winchester crown court. Nicknamed All-Talk Turner because of his boasting, he met Emily in December 2010. The pair were well known in the bars and clubs of Bournemouth and Poole.
But Turner, who had a history of obsession with women, soon showed signs of jealousy and the short volatile relationship descended into violent arguments. The court was told he threatened to kill his girlfriend almost every day.
He was described by the prosecution as "threatening, aggressive, violent, controlling and possessive towards" Emily. She went home to Auckland, New Zealand, to see her parents in April last year and Turner was incensed by Facebook pictures of her with ex-boyfriends and other men.
When Emily returned, she wanted to leave Turner and, after an argument triggered by his obsession, she slept with his best friend.
In the days before her death, Turner accessed her phone and Facebook accounts and found out she was arranging to meet men. He went to one club in Bournemouth, armed with a lump hammer, when he learned she was out with another man.
He did not find Emily but told friends he had killed her with a hammer and dumped her body in bushes before admitting it was a joke.
On the night of 6 May, Turner was furious when he met Emily and saw she was dressed in very short shorts, a leopard print bra and small waistcoat. He told her she was dressed like a whore. They argued and she threw a drink over him.
