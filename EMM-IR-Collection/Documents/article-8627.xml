  <text>The deadline for a UN-backed ceasefire in Syria aimed at halting more than a year of violence passed today with no immediate reports of fighting, activists said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the sound of explosions in the town of Zabadani, close to the border with Lebanon, shortly after the 6am deadline expired but said it was not clear what had caused the blasts. Other activists in the cities of Hama, Homs and Damascus said the situation was calm.
The Syrian government last night agreed to halt all military activity by 6am today, according to UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
British prime minister David Cameron today urged Russia and China to back further United Nations measures to "tighten the noose" around President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
Dr Assad is deliberately flouting the Annan peace plan, Mr Cameron said as he travelled to Malaysia on the third day of a visit to Asia. The prime minister said he feels an immense sense of frustration because the world came together behind the Annan plan, including countries such as China and Russia.
"Now is the time to say to the Russians and the Chinese, look at the man we are dealing with, look at the appalling way he is behaving," Mr Cameron said. "We need to go back to the UN and tighten the pressure, tighten the noose."
The ceasefire announcement, also broadcast on Syrian state television, coincided with clashes in the north where troops were mopping up areas held by rebels for several months. Opposition spokesmen reported that troops shelled a six-storey mall in the central city of Homs and that there was fighting between defectors and loyalist troops on the outskirts of Damascus.
The Syrian state news agency Sana said gunmen had killed Brig Gen Jamal Khaled and his driver in a suburb of the capital, while the Syrian Revolution General Commission reported at least 16 people killed, most of them in Deraa, Homs and the Damascus area. Five of those died under torture, it said.
Fighting was also reported between government troops and the rebel Free Syrian Army in Deraa and Idlib. Shots fired by Syrian troops hit a refugee camp on the Turkish side of the border.
Avaaz, the citizen journalist network, said people in Deir Baalba found the bodies of 18 men who had been taken to a warehouse, where they were tortured before being executed and their bodies set on fire.
While the UN has ruled out military intervention in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, which favour such involvement, have provided funds and arms to the rebels, while Turkey is hosting hundreds of army defectors who have conducted cross-border raids into Syria.
The United States, United Kingdom and France have also supplied the rebels with non-lethal aid, such as medical supplies and communications equipment.
A ceasefire could ease the concerns of neighbouring countries hosting tens of thousands of Syrian refugees. It is estimated that there are 24,000 in Turkey, 95,000 in Jordan and more than 8,000 in Lebanon. The UN puts the death toll during 13 months of violence at 9,000 while the government says that more than 2,500 security men and soldiers have been killed.
