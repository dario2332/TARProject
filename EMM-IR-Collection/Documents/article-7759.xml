  <text>The White House also saw no sign of a pullback: "Leaders of the Assad regime ... make a lot of promises," spokesman Jay Carney said. "Those promises overwhelmingly turn out to be empty."
Nor did rebels immediately stop shooting. The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said insurgents killed six soldiers in attacks on checkpoints on an eastern desert road.
State media reported the funerals of 33 security personnel on Tuesday, bringing to 58 the number it said had been killed in two days. Syrian government media curbs make it hard to verify reports from inside the country.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem demanded guarantees from Annan that rebels would also honor any truce.
"We will not ask the terrorist groups, which are killing, kidnapping and destroying infrastructure, for guarantees. We want Annan to give us these guarantees," Moualem said during a visit to Moscow.
The rebel Free Syrian Army will fight on if Assad fails to withdraw troops and tanks from in and around cities as required, a spokesman, Colonel Qassem Saad al-Deen, told Reuters.
The opposition Syrian National Council said Syrian forces were not complying and that world powers should impose an arms embargo and other measures if the peace plan failed.
China, which along with Russia has blocked punitive UN Security Council action against Syria, said it hoped all sides would immediately obey the UN-backed ceasefire, aimed at stopping the uprising from sliding into full-scale civil war.
Moualem said some troops had already pulled back from cities in line with the peace plan, but he tied a full ceasefire to the entry of foreign monitors, another apparently new condition.
