Activists say Syrian troops are shelling neighbourhoods in the opposition stronghold of Homs, hours after the arrival of a first team of UN truce monitors to Damascus.
The Local Co-ordination Committees and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said two people were killed in Hama in central Syria today when security forces opened fire on their car.
The weekend pounding of Homs along with scattered violence in other areas raises new doubts about president Bashar Assad’s commitment to a plan by special envoy Kofi Annan to end 13 months of violence.
A six-member advance team of UN observers arrived in Syria on Sunday night to observe the shaky truce. Annan’s spokesman Ahmad Fawzi says in Geneva the remaining 25 observers are expected to arrive within days.
