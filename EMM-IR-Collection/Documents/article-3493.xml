  <text>Journalist Marie Colvin, an American, was reportedly killed in an apparent mortar strike in Homs, Syria.
Valerie Pecresse, a spokeswoman for the French government, confirmed the deaths to reporters in Paris, the Associated Press reported.
It was difficult to learn details about the mortar strike that killed the duo, because the Syrian government tightly controls access to Homs and other parts of the country, and communication to the city  is sporadically cut off.
Mohammad Diab, an activist originally from Homs, said the journalists had entered the city without permission from Syrian authorities and were in a house in the Baba Amr neighborhood with other foreign journalists when the building was hit. Anti-government activists in Homs told Diab, who is based in Beirut, that a third journalist, as yet unidentified, was seriously injured.
Wissam Tarif of the Avaaz human rights group said seven activists were also killed in the attack. The neighborhood, which has for months been a center of an increasingly armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been under bombardment with heavy artillery for almost three weeks.
Diab said that Tuesday was a particularly bloody day, with 41 people killed in Baba Amr alone, including a Syrian activist named Rami al-Sayed who had for months filmed demonstrations in Homs and posted them to YouTube.
World leaders are expected to meet in Tunis on Friday to discuss possible solutions to the Syrian crisis, and top U.S. officials appeared to signal on Tuesday that they would consider arming the Syrian rebels if Assad's military continued to bombard civilians. In the meantime, the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed to Syrian officials to allow a daily two-hour truce in the areas where fighting is ongoing, so it can offer aid.
