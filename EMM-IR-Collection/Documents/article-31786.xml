Opposition forces told AFP that 33 more people were killed overnight in a fresh military offensive by government forces in the restive town of Hama, northeast of Houla, while 15 others died in other incidents around the nation.
Seven of yesterday's fatalities in Hama were children, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Forty-nine children and 34 women were among the 108 slain in Houla, where artillery and tanks launched a barrage before troops attacked in one of the single bloodiest incidents in the 14-month uprising against Syrian President Bashar al Assad's regime.
Five women and four military deserters were also among the Hama victims, said the observatory.
"There was fighting among soldiers and deserters. The soldiers were killed and the army responded violently, directly targeting residential areas," militants in Hama said.
"People came out on to the streets shouting that they needed medical help. One house was bombarded and collapsed on its inhabitants," they said.
News of the assault on Hama came following an emergency UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Syria, focusing on the Houla tragedy. The council said in a statement that those responsible for the killings "must be held accountable."
The head of the UN mission in Syria, Major General Robert Mood, briefed the 15-member group on the details of the massacre in a closed-door meeting.
Afterward, the council denounced the Houla attacks, which "involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighbourhood."
They also condemned "the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse" and called for an investigation.
British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant acknowledged that the statement of condemnation was "not sufficient" to stop the violence in Syria.
"Over the next two days, the Security Council will be meeting again to discuss in more detail what steps need to be taken," he said.
The council reiterated its support for UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan, a day before he was set to fly to Damascus.
Syria's government denied any role in the 12-hour artillery barrage that began Friday afternoon, targeting a string of villages northwest of Homs. Hama lies 50km north of Homs, with Houla at roughly midpoint between the two.
The UN says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the uprising against Assad, while activists put the figure at over 13,000.
