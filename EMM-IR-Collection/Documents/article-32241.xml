  <text>Both men condemned the massacre of at least 108 people in the Syrian town of 
  Houla on Friday, but Mr Lavrov stressed that both government forces and 
  rebel troops had done the killing.
With Russia facing mounting pressure to join global calls for the Syrian 
  leader's removal after the horrific massacre in Houla, there was little 
  outward indication, as suggested in US media reports, that Russia was 
  warming to the idea.
Mr Hague said he was pleased that Russia had reiterated its support for the 
  Annan plan, which calls for a ceasefire and a pulling back of troops.
After the press conference, he said he urged Russia to put more pressure on 
  the government of its Soviet-era ally to keep to the terms of Mr Annan's 
  six-point proposal. He said Syria was at risk of descending "closer and 
  closer to all-out civil war and collapse" if the Annan plan was not 
"It is urgent to make every effort to start the political process and to 
  encourage - of course, we must all encourage - the Assad regime to implement 
  the plan they have not yet implemented. I think that Russia has an important 
  role to play in that, as we discussed today," he said.
Speaking alongside his Russian counterpart, he offered a much starker 
  assessment of what had happened at Houla.
He said the Syrian government bore the "primary responsibility" for the 
  massacre. "This particular tragedy has again drawn the attention of the 
  world to what is happening in Syria," he said, stressing that there had been 
  "a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential 
  neighbourhood" and the "killing of civilians by shooting at close range, and 
  by severe physical abuse".
Mr Lavrov agreed there had been government shelling but added that "obviously 
  both sides had a hand in the deaths of innocent people, including several 
The Russian foreign minister insisted there must be no foreign intervention to 
  force regime change in Syria. However, he offered a glimmer of hope to those 
  lobbying for Assad's removal, saying it was "not the main issue who was in 
  power" the priority was to stop the violence.
Mr Hague said that it was Britain's longstanding position that Mr Assad should 
  step down, but that the immediate priority was multilateral cooperation to 
  implement the Annan peace plan. He stressed that Russia had "a particularly 
  powerful role to exert pressure" to that end.
Mr Lavrov said Moscow did not support Mr Assad's government and was pressuring 
  it "on a daily basis".
He claimed, however, that foreign powers were undermining Russia's efforts by 
  pressuring the rebels to provoke conflict, in order to destroy any peace 
  plan and justify a request for outside intervention.
"We support the Annan peace plan, which is addressed to both the Syrian 
  government and the armed opposition," said Mr Lavrov. "It takes two to dance 
  but the current situation is more like a discotheque than a tango. We must
