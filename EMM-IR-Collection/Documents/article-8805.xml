  <text>Syria is reported to be calm after a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect at dawn.
The government has pledged to abide by the truce despite escalating attacks on towns and cities across the country in the hours ahead of the 0400 BST deadline.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition group, said there had been no immediate reports of violence on Thursday morning.
Rami Abdel Rahman said "the situation is calm in all regions".
"There has not been any movement indicating a withdrawal of tanks," he added.
An opposition activist in Homs told Sky News that the shelling had halted but government tanks and snipers were still stationed around the city.
The regime is meant to withdraw its forces from urban areas as part of the ceasefire deal brokered by UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
Pledging compliance with the truce, the Syrian government assured Mr Annan that it would halt its military operations while reserving the right to respond to any attacks by what it called "armed terrorist groups".
The Free Syrian Army - the main force of opposition fighters - says it is committed to the ceasefire but has demanded the withdrawal of government forces within the next 48 hours.
The opposition Syrian National Council has voiced doubts about the regime's intentions."The Syrian people together with the international community will be watching carefully and monitoring the regime's deeds on the ground," said the council's foreign relations chief Bassma Kodmani.
An advance "planning team" from the UN which was negotiating access for a team of UN observers to monitor the truce has left Syria with no explanation.
It is not clear whether the regime has agreed to a plan to deploy some 200 unarmed UN troops to monitor compliance.
Mr Annan is due to update the UN Security Council via video link from his office in Geneva later.
Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for tough action against the regime of President Bashar al Assad if it fails to halt the violence.
"This is a very important moment," he said.
"If there isn't a ceasefire or it isn't upheld, in the view of the United Kingdom, we will want to return to the UN Security Council - and intensify our support for the Syrian opposition."
US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed in a telephone call that the UN Security Council needed to "take more resolute action" on Syria."The President and Chancellor shared the concern that the Assad government was not complying with the terms of the agreement negotiated by Kofi Annan and continued to engage in unacceptable brutality against its own people," the White House said.
The ceasefire is part of a six-point peace plan that also requires access for humanitarian aid, free movement for journalists, and the right for the Syrian people to protest peacefully without being attacked.
If the first steps are achieved there will be an attempt to arrange negotiations between the government and the opposition to reach an agreed end to the crisis that has claimed at least 9,000 lives over the past 13 months.
Oh dear! Here we go again! Yet another British Foreign Secretary rattling his sabre. Hasn't he noticed what has been done to the armed forces? Syria is not and never has been our business, just as Libya wasn't. Our intervention in Libya prolonged the bloodshed and has produced an Islamic regime.
here we go again Libya Volume II .More sabre rattling from us with an army we keep sacking !! Watch the tories start a war with them blow another couple of billion ...........then say "it was labours fault we are in this mess"
A useless bag of wind and .......
Every body here seems to support the Assad regimes absolute right, to do to the Syrian people, exactly whatever they want to. Such power has always commanded respect and admiration in some people even here. Its really easy to kill thousands of civilians and it seems that not alot of people really care two hoots. But if our armed forces make and unfortunate error - woe betide! Change the government!
