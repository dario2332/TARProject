  <text>Syrian human rights activists have said more than 50 people have been killed by government forces in the province of Homs.
Pro-democracy campaigners claimed at least 13 of those who died in shelling in the town of Houla were children.
"It was a real massacre that took place and the UN observers are just staying silent," the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, said.
The latest violence comes as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and tanks were reportedly deployed to counter public action after Friday prayers.
The latest flare-up of violence has been reported as UN-Arab League envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, who brokered a repeatedly-violated ceasefire last month, finalised plans to return to Damascus.
Diplomats in Geneva said the former UN secretary general would visit the Syrian capital early next week.
Syria's main opposition bloc put the death toll higher and urged the UN Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to examine the claimed massacre.
"Some of the victims were hit by heavy artillery while others, entire families, were massacred," Bassma Kodmani, of the Syrian National Council, said.
The reports and death tolls across Syria could not be independently verified.
For the first time since the uprising against President Assad's regime erupted 14 months ago army tanks also rumbled through Aleppo, the London-based Syrian Observatory watchdog said.
Meanwhile, a report by current UN leader Ban Ki-moon said that groups fighting President Bashar Assad now control "significant" parts of some cities and there is "considerable physical destruction" across the country.
"There is a continuing crisis on the ground, characterised by regular violence, deteriorating humanitarian conditions, human rights violations and continued political confrontation," the report said.
The report is to be debated by the UN Security Council next week.
