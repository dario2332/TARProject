  <text>The operation came after two days of the worst rioting to have
hit Egypt since the fall of former president Hosni Mubarak in
February. With only a week to go until the first round of
parliamentary elections, it casts a dark shadow over the supposed
centrepiece of the Egypt’s transition to democracy.
When the troops began to move into the square, cries of ‘Gesh,
Gesh, Gesh’ (Army, Army, Army) quickly spread through the crowd,
sparking a stampede. Doormen in buildings on side streets forced
their doors shut on panicked protesters desperately trying to
After most of the square had been cleared, armoured vehicles
drove in to fire tear gas at the defiant few who remained. The
Independent witnessed a group of unarmed male protesters cornered
by troops and beaten with batons and riot shields; when the army
moved away, six men lay prone on the roadside. After two other
protesters attempted unsuccessfully to revive another man, a
military policeman dragged him to the same heap.
State troops quickly removed the unconscious men, making it
impossible to confirm whether they were alive or dead. But Ghada
Shabender of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights, who spent
time in the square’s makeshift field hospital, said that her
organisation had confirmed at least five deaths. She said doctors
had reported a military police attack on the hospital. “They said
it was stormed by the military police who threw in a tear gas
canister, the doctors responded with you can’t take them from our
care, and would not leave,” she said.
There were multiple other reports of abuses. Pasant, a
24-year-old estate agent, said that she had been groped by a
soldier as she lay on the ground. “They kept saying we deserved the
beating as we were protesting,” she said.
Ahmed Malek, a 17-year-old Egyptian high school student, said
that the army attacked protesters indiscriminately. “They were
hitting men, ladies and children, who were screaming “please don’t
beat us leave us alone,’” Ahmed said. “One soldier stole my mobile
and he took my gas mask.”
Last night’s operation came on the heels of two days of severe
unrest across the country.
Since Saturday afternoon protesters had been fighting running
battles with riot police in central Cairo, turning parts of the
city centre into a rubble-strewn conflict zone.
The trouble flared after a few dozen activists were arrested and
severely beaten by police on Saturday morning after they stayed the
night in Tahrir Square.
As word of the incident spread on social networking sites,
thousands of activists began to descend on the centre of the
capital. What initially began as a show of support for the arrested
activists had, by tonight, morphed into a violent eruption of
suppressed rage directed at the ruling military council.
The streets around Tahrir Square were awash with rubble as
protesters hurled rocks and petrol bombs at riot police. Activists
could be seen rushing back from the front lines, retching from the
swirling clouds of tear gas. Others started fires using uprooted
According to Sara Mahmoud, a 23-year-old human resources worker
who was one of those caught up in the violence, tonight Egypt is
witnessing a “second revolution”.
“This is just a disaster,” she said, as riot police blasted
rubber buckshot pellets down Mohammed Mahmoud Street, the road
leading off Tahrir Square where some of the worst clashes took
place. “It’s Egyptians shooting other Egyptians.”
Website manager Hossam al-Din, wearing a vinegar-soaked surgical
mask to protect himself from the clouds of acrid tear gas, said: “I
feel confused and I don’t know what we should do. But the military
has to hand over power to a civilian government –it’s not as
complicated as they tell us.”
Just hours before the military police stormed Tahrir Square, a
general from the ruling military council issued a stern warning to
civilians not to threaten Egypt’s national security. "The aim of
what is going on is to shake the backbone of the state, which is
the armed forces,” said Maj. Gen. Mohsen el-Fangari in a phone call
to one of Egypt’s private TV stations.
The military, which for decades has been venerated by many
Egyptians as a guardian of the nation, enjoyed considerable
goodwill after taking power following the fall of Hosni Mubarak in
But there has been mounting disquiet among political parties and
activist groups about how willing the ruling generals are to
oversee a transition to genuine civilian rule.
The government recently published a proposal suggesting that the
army should be beyond constitutional oversight – a blueprint that
was widely rejected by Egypt’s various political factions.
Relations between the military and protesters have also been
exacerbated by the use of military courts to process thousands of
civilians and the refusal of generals to set a precise date for
presidential elections.
