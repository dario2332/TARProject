  <text>Colonel Vasily Panchenkov, a spokesman for interior ministry forces, said the troops were being drafted in for people's protection.
"They have just one aim - to ensure the security of the citizens," he told Interfax.
Interior ministry spokesperson Oleg Yelnikov played down the deployment, telling Sky News: "Interior Ministry forces were moved into Moscow at the beginning of the voting process and will stay until the votes are counted and the results announced. They are here to ensure public order...
"The forces will be used as necessary. We should be prepared for anything."
Preliminary results show the party got 49.5% of the vote, one of the worst election results of Mr Putin's 12-year rule, which gives it a slim 13-seat majority.
Prominent activist Ilya Yashin and opposition blogger Alexei Navalny were arrested for their roles in Monday's protest which saw people take their discontent to the streets of Moscow, chanting "Russia without Putin".
Yashin was sentenced on Tuesday afternoon to 15 days in jail. Navalny's lawyer has not been able to speak to his client and says he does not know where he is.
Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin has promised a "significant reshuffle" following the presidential election next year in an attempt to calm anger that has spilled onto the streets.
