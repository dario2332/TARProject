  <text>Street battles between pro and anti-Syrian groups in the Lebanese capital killed two people overnight and wounded 15 as the spiralling conflict in neighbouring Syria spilled across the border.
Some Beirut residents kept their children home from school following the fighting, which was among the worst the Lebanese capital has seen in four years. Gunmen fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in battles that lasted more than four hours.
The violence in the predominantly Sunni area of Tariq Jadidah erupted hours after an anti-Syrian cleric and his bodyguard were shot dead at a checkpoint in northern Lebanon, an incident that instantly spiked tensions.
Authorities are braced for the possibility of more violence in the north, where Sunni cleric Sheik Ahmed Abdul-Wahid and his bodyguard are due to be buried. Gunmen carrying automatic rifles shouted for the downfall of the Syrian regime in the cleric's hometown of Beireh.
The fighting underscores how the bloodshed in Syria, where President Bashar Assad's regime is cracking down on an uprising against his rule, can fuel violence across the border in Lebanon.
Lebanon and Syria share a complex web of political and sectarian ties and rivalries, which can easily turn violent. Last week, clashes sparked by the Syrian crisis killed at least eight people and wounded dozens in the northern city of Tripoli.
The revolt in Syria began 15 months ago, and there are fears the unrest will lead to a regional conflagration that could draw in neighbouring countries. The UN estimates the conflict has killed more than 9,000 people since March 2011.
Syrian activists said regime forces killed dozens of people during a raid on Sunday on the central town of Soran in Hama province, security officials said.
One activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, put the death toll at 39, citing a network of sources on the ground. Syria-based activist Mustafa Osso said the figure was more than 20.
The death toll could not be independently confirmed. A video posted online by activists showed the bodies of five people said to be of the same family who were killed during the shelling of Soran.
