  <text>The U.N. Security Council is calling on Syria "to urgently and visibly" fulfill its pledge to halt the use of troops and heavy weapons in cities and towns by the April 10 deadline.
The presidential statement read at a formal council meeting Thursday morning also calls on all parties, including the opposition, "to cease armed violence in all its forms" within 48 hours of the Syria pullout being fully implemented.
The statement raised the possibility of "further steps" if Syria doesn't implement the six-point peace plan outlined by international envoy Kofi Annan, which President Bashar Assad agreed to on April 1.
Annan was scheduled to brief the U.N. General Assembly by videoconference at an open meeting later Thursday morning.
