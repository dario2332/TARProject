KABUL:  Taliban militants launched a series of co-ordinated attacks across Kabul yesterday, targeting at least three neighbourhoods that are home to Afghan government buildings, Western embassies and NATO bases.
NATO forces said in a statement that as many as seven locations were under attack across the capital.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the assault. He said a group of armed suicide bombers had launched an attack on NATO forces headquarters, parliament and a number of diplomatic residences in Kabul.

Gunfire and several explosions were reported in the area near the German and British embassies and a major NATO military camp, usually a heavily guarded area of the city. Rockets also landed near the British and Canadian embassies and World Bank office, The New York Times reported.
Witnesses said suicide bombers had taken over the newly built Kabul Star hotel, which was reportedly on fire in an area which includes a major US military base, the United Nations office and the presidential palace.
Several other attackers tried to enter  parliament but were engaged by security forces and driven back, an official said.
They had taken cover in a building near the parliament and fighting was ongoing, a parliamentary media officer, Qudratullah Jawid, told AFP.
Kabul's police chief, Mohammad Ayoubi Salangi, said at least one attacker had been killed as fighting raged in several locations.
''Near the parliament, the first floor of a neighbouring building has been taken by police and one terrorist is dead,'' he said. In two other areas of the city militants had taken positions in tall buildings and ''are firing'', he said.
As the Kabul attacks began, several large explosions and bursts of gunfire were heard near the US embassy. The embassy sounded alarms and warned staff to take cover, AFP reporters heard from their office near the embassy in the Wazir Akbar Khan area.
A police spokesman said the areas under attack were the diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan in the centre, parliament in the west and District Nine in the south. The US embassy said in a statement there had been attacks ''in the vicinity''.
There were also attacks in two other eastern cities - Jalalabad and Gardez.
Meanwhile, an AP reporter at the Turkish military base on the outskirts of Kabul said the installation was under direct attack from mortar fire. Turkish and Greek forces were responding with heavy-calibre machinegun fire.
It was the first attack in Kabul since a shooting inside the Interior Ministry in February in which a ministry employee turned a gun on NATO advisers and shot two soldiers dead.
The incidents come as Taliban militants step up their attacks as part of their annual spring offensive, heralding the so-called fighting season.
