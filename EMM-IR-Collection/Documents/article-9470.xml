A picture released by the opposition Shaam News Network shows an anti-government demonstration in the al-Waer neighborhood of the restive city of Homs on Friday.
At least one anti-government protester was shot dead, Reuters reported, after Syrians poured into the streets Friday in the first major test of a fragile United Nations-brokered truce.
Opposition leaders called for widespread demonstrations. The Associated Press, citing activists, said thousands of people were responding to those calls.
Syrian forces tightened security in public squares and outside mosques Friday. President Bashar Assad's regime has cracked down on such rallies in the past and has suggested it would not allow them to resume, insisting protesters need to seek permission first.

An outbreak of violence at a chaotic rally could give government forces a pretext for ending the truce, which formally took effect the day before.
The first day of the United Nations brokered ceasefire in Syria has held. There was no bombardment by Syrian forces.  However, U.N. envoy Kofi Annan says by failing to withdraw its troops and heavy weapons, Syria has not fully complied with the peace plan. ITV's Neil Connery has been monitoring the ceasefire from neighboring Beirut.
The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told Reuters that sources in the city of Hama said one person was shot dead by security forces as people tried to converge on a central square.

However, an activist with the anti-Assad Local Coordination Committees said put the death toll at two. It was unclear if they were reporting the same or different incidents.
Activists said security forces had fired in the air to scatter protesters in at least one area in the restive Idlib province, The Associated Press said.
