  <text>The city of Southampton paid tribute to the victims of the Titanic with a one minute silence. It was 100 years ago the greatest liner of its generation slipped its moorings from berth 43 of the seaport.
Wreaths were thrown into the water. Of those that perished in the Atlantic as Titanic sank to the bottom of the ocean were more than 500 crew members who had called Southampton home. Many of their relatives were quayside to pay their respects.
Among the 1,300 passengers was Philip Littlejohn whose grandfather, a 1st Class Steward on the doomed ship, survived.
