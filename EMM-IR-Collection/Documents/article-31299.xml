Friday's assault on Houla, an area northwest of the central city of Homs, was one of the bloodiest single events in Syria's 15-month-old uprising. The U.N. said 32 of the dead were under the age of 10.
In this photo from opposition activists, demonstrators protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Yabroud, near Idlib, on Friday.
The attacks sparked outrage from American and other international leaders, and renewed concerns about the relevance of a month-old international peace plan that hasn't stopped almost daily violence.
Sunday's shelling hit neighborhoods in the central city of Hama and the rebel-held town of Rastan north of Homs, the Local Coordination Committees and the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The two groups also reported clashes between troops and rebels in Hama, in the Damascus suburb of Harasta and in the capital's central Midan district. A bomb struck a security vehicle in the capital's upscale district of Mazzeh, near a military airport, according to the LCC.
The Observatory said the vehicle bombing caused casualties but didn't have other details on the dead or wounded from the day's violence.
Take a look back over the highlights of the past year in Syria in a timeline, and review the latest events in a map.
A video posted online by activists showed thick black smoke billowing from what it said was Mazzeh.
Damascus is tightly controlled by regime forces but has been hit by a wave of blasts over recent months that claimed the lives of scores of people. Most of the blasts have targeted Syrian security agencies.
Syria's foreign ministry spokesman has denied government troops were behind the Houla attacks. Jihad Makdissi told reporters in Damascus at a Sunday news conference that Syria is being subjected to a "tsunami of lies" blaming the government. He said anti-government gunmen carried out the attack.
"We categorically deny the responsibility of government forces for the massacre," Mr. Makdissi said.
Mr. Makdissi says a committee was sent to investigate the case and results should be out within three days.
Kuwait, which currently heads the 22-member Cairo-based Arab League, announced it is making contacts for holding an Arab ministerial meeting that aims to "take steps to put an end to the oppressive practices against the Syrian people."
An unnamed foreign ministry official was quoted by Kuwait's state-controlled news agency, KUNA, as condemning the attack in Houla and blamed regime forces for the "ugly crime."
The U.N. denounced the attacks in a statement that appeared to hold President Bashar al-Assad's regime responsible, while the White House condemned the violence as acts of "unspeakable and inhuman brutality."
The bloodshed is yet another blow to the international peace plan brokered by U.N. envoy Kofi Annan and cast a pall over his coming visit to check on the plan's progress. The cease-fire between forces loyal to the regime of Assad and rebels seeking to topple it was supposed to start on April 12 but has never really taken hold, with new killings every day.
The U.N. put the death toll weeks ago at more than 9,000. Hundreds have been killed since.

The two remaining candidates in Egypt's presidential election are appealing for support from voters who rejected them as polarizing extremists in the first round, even as the third-placed candidate contests the preliminary results.
Government troops shelled residential areas in central Syria, activists said, two days after the bombardment of a string of villages in the same region killed more than 90, many of them children.
