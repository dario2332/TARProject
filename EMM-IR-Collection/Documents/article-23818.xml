  <text>At least four people have been killed and 50 injured after a powerful earthquake struck northern Italy early on Sunday, reducing historic buildings to rubble and burying cars under tonnes of debris. The epicentre of the 5.9 earthquake was at Finale Emilia, a town 22 miles north of Bologna. The force of the quake was felt throughout northeastern Italy, from Florence to Venice and as far away as the German speaking area of South Tyrol, on the border with Austria. The affected region includes some of Italy's most attractive small cities, including Ferrara, Modena and Mantua, famed for countless artistic and historic treasures, from frescoes to ancient churches and castles. The quake, which struck at 4am local time, led to the partial collapse of several historic stone towers and church steeples. It comes three years after a powerful quake devastated the mountain city of L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region, killing more than 300 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.
