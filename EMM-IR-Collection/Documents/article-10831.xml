  <text>The first group of the UN observers, designed to watch over the fulfillment of Kofi Annan's peace plan, has arrived in Syria.
As reported by the BBC Russian, the first group of the UN international observers, which is to monitor the compliance with the ceasefire in Syria, has arrived to the country.
The group consists of six members. They must start their work on Monday morning, spokesman for the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations Kieran Dwyer said.
Recall, Plan of the UN and the League of Arab States (LAS) special envoy, General Kofi Annan, which provides cessation of violence in Syria, came into force yesterday at 6 am local time. Official Damascus has promised Annan to adhere to the terms of this truce, starting at the specified hour.
International observers and human rights activists confirmed that the situation in Syria at the moment is calm, and Damascus has carried out international obligations under Kofi Annan's peace plan.
