  <text>PanARMENIAN.Net -   Government troops shelled residential areas in central Syria on Sunday, May 27, activists said, two days after the bombardment of a string of villages in the same region killed more than 90, many of them children, according to the Associated Press.
The attacks sparked outrage from American and other international leaders, and renewed concerns about the relevance of a month-old international peace plan that has not stopped almost daily violence.
A video posted online by activists showed thick black smoke billowing from what it said was Mazzeh.
