  <text>A number of young men blocked the roads leading to Nahr Abu Ali roundabout in Tripoli using tires and steel barriers, the National News Agency reported on Sunday.
Their move followed the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, which sparked tension in Akkar and Tripoli.
According to AFP, a security official said army troops shot dead Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria. -NOW Lebanon
