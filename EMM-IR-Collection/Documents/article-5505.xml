  <text>The United States on Wednesday voiced doubts that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would comply with a peace plan deadline, criticizing an "intensification" of violence against opponents.
Syrian activists said government forces pressed a crackdown on rebel bastions on Wednesday, killing at least 52 people, despite Assad's promise to pull troops and heavy weapons out of protest cities by April 10.
"What we've seen, frankly, is an intensification of artillery bombardments in major population centers like Homs and Edleb," State Department spokesperson Mark Toner told reporters.
"So we've yet to be convinced that they have any intention of complying with the April 10 deadline," Toner said.
Former UN chief Kofi Annan, who is serving as a UN-Arab League envoy, said Monday that Assad had agreed to start "immediately" pulling out troops under a six-point peace plan.
But The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops stormed and shelled several towns or villages on Wednesday, a day after it said another 80 people were killed.
The United States has repeatedly urged Assad to step down an end the year-long crackdown on protests that the United Nations says has claimed more than 9,000 lives.
