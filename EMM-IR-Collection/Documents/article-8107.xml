Kofi Annan said that the Syrian government had assured him it will respect a 
  ceasefire with rebel forces, less than 24 hours before a deadline to suspend 
"I have received government assurances they will respect the ceasefire. 
  If everyone respects it I think by six o'clock in the morning on Thursday we 
  shall see improved conditions on the ground," Mr Annan said during a 
  visit to Iran's capital Tehran to shore up support for a peace plan backed 
  by the United Nations and Arab League.
But amateur footage uploaded online appeared to show Syrian forces pressing 
  home a sustained assault on opponents of President Bashar al-Assad in Homs 
  on Tuesday, ignoring an international peace plan under which troops were to 
  silence their guns and withdraw from urban areas.
The videos cannot be independently verified due to reporting restrictions in Syria.
