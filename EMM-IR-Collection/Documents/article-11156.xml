Heavy street fighting in the Afghan capital has ended, with all the Taliban militants who launched coordinated attacks on Kabul killed, officials said.Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the attackers' last two strongholds - in the diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan and near the parliament - had been cleared, ending 18 hours of intense gunfire, rocket attacks and explosions.In all, officials said 36 insurgents were killed in fighting across the country, while eight Afghan soldiers and three civilians died. More than 60 people were injured.Kabul was hit by a wave of attacks in three areas starting at noon on Sunday (local time), with embassies and foreign military bases coming under fire in what Taliban insurgents said was the start of their spring offensive.Battles gripped the capital's central districts through the night, with explosions and gunfire lighting up alleys and surrounding streets.Afghan security forces took the lead in countering the assault, but a spokesman for NATO forces in the country said they had provided air support in response to requests from the Afghans.The US, British, German and Japanese embassy compounds came under fire as militants attacked the city's diplomatic enclave and tried to storm parliament, sparking a gun battle as MPs and bodyguards fired back from the rooftop.Security forces eventually flushed out militants holed up in the heavily guarded diplomatic area.NATO helicopters had launched strafing attack runs on gunmen hiding in a construction site overlooking the NATO headquarters.Elite soldiers scaled scaffolding to outflank the insurgents, who appeared to have dug them themselves in on the second floor from the top of the construction site.Outside the capital, militants attacked government buildings in Logar province, the airport in Jalalabad and a police facility in the town of Gardez in Paktya province where a NATO helicopter was reportedly deployed against them.Show of strengthThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks, but some officials said the Haqqanis - a network of tribal militants who live along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border - were likely involved.The assault by the insurgents is one of the most serious on the capital since US-backed Afghan forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.The attacks highlight the ability of militants to strike the diplomatic zone of the city even after more than 10 years of war."These attacks are the beginning of the spring offensive and we had planned them for months," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.He said the onslaught was revenge for a series of incidents involving American troops in Afghanistan - including the burning of Korans at a NATO base and the massacre of 17 civilians by a US soldier - and vowed there would be more such attacks.
