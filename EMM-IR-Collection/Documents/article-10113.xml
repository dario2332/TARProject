  <text>The UN Security Council has unanimously agreed to send an advance team of 30 peace monitors to Syria. They will be monitoring compliance with the ceasefire which took effect Thursday in accordance with the Annan settlement plan. The resolution adopted Saturday gave UN head Ban Ki-moon until next Thursday to report about action on it.
It also included Russian-tabled amendments aimed at removing the wording which Russia believed had nothing to do with the Annan plan. Russia and Syria described that wording as 'one-sided and smacking of an ultimatum'.
In its Saturday resolution, the Security Council expressed its unanimous support of Kofi Annan's settlement blueprint for Syria. It also welcomed the fact that Thursday's ceasefire is largely holding and regretted the loss of thousands of lives in the Syrian conflict.
