  <text>UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said today the Syrian government have assured him they will respect a ceasefire with rebel forces, less than 24 hours before a deadline to suspend hostilities.
"I have received government assurances they will respect the ceasefire. If everyone respects it I think by six in the morning on Thursday we shall see improved conditions on the ground," Mr Annan said during a visit to Tehran to shore up support for his United Nations and Arab League-backed peace plan.
Mr Annan warned today any further militarisation of the conflict in Syria would be "disastrous and have unimaginable consequences".
Speaking alongside Mr Annan, Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi said: "The opportunity must be given to the Syrian government to make changes under the leadership of Bashar al Assad.
"The people of Syria should be able to enjoy rights such as freedom of political parties and freedom of elections, but "at the same time we have announced that we oppose interference in the affairs of all nations including Syria," he said.
Yesterday, Mr Annan said the Syrian government should fundamentally change what it was doing.
His remarks came as troops and armoured detachments loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad continued assaults on several cities. On the day that heavy weapons were supposed to be withdrawn from urban centres, shelling continued, including on Homs and Hama, leaving at least 31 dead, according to the Syrian opposition.
Earlier, Syrian opposition spokesmen rejected government claims that troops had pulled out of population centres in some provinces in compliance with the Annan plan.
Instead, local activists said helicopter gunships overflew the north, tanks roamed the streets of Homs and Hama and arrest raids were conducted in Deraa province.
The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said gunmen killed 11 soldiers while the state news agency said an attack in the Aleppo region alone accounted for the deaths of nine members of the security forces and one civilian. It said 33 law enforcement officers were laid to rest.
The rebel Free Syrian Army and other groups have refused to observe a ceasefire until government forces pull out of population centres and halt hostilities. The Syrian National Council, an umbrella grouping of expatriate factions, said government forces killed 1,000 over the past eight days. This figure is unverified.
Under the Annan proposal troops, tanks and heavy weapons were to be withdrawn from urban centres by yesterday morning and government forces and rebels were to cease hostilities by Thursday morning.
