"It is absolutely clear that terrorist groups are behind this: al-Qaeda and those groups that work with al-Qaeda"

DAMASCUS:  Fierce clashes between regime forces and armed rebels in central Syria yesterday killed 23 regime soldiers and wounded dozens, a human rights groups said, as the European Union slapped fresh sanctions on Damascus.
Also yesterday, Russia said it was ''absolutely clear'' that al-Qaeda and its associates were behind twin bomb attacks in the Syrian capital last week that killed 55 people.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three troop carriers were destroyed in clashes that began at dawn on the outskirts of Rastan, a rebel-held city  in restive Homs province.
A lieutenant who had defected was also killed in the violence.
Regime forces launched an offensive on the city at the weekend but have met with sharp resistance from rebels seeking the ouster of the regime of the President, Bashar al-Assad.
The Observatory said dozens had been wounded in shelling of the city by Syrian troops.
And in Quraya in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, a 15-year-old boy was killed by machine gun fire as regime forces raided the town, the British watchdog said, bringing the total number of people killed  yesterday to 25.
The deadly unrest comes despite a month-old ceasefire brokered by the United Nations-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan as part of a six-point plan aimed at ending violence that has swept Syria since March last year, when a popular revolt erupted against Mr Assad's regime.
The plan includes the deployment in key areas of about 300 UN military observers. By Sunday, 189 observers had arrived, the UN mission in Syria said.
Despite the presence of the observers, more than 60 people were killed across Syria at the weekend in raids and shelling attacks by regime forces on rebel strongholds, and in clashes between soldiers and armed rebels, the Observatory said.
More than 12,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have died since the Syrian uprising began in March last year. On the diplomatic front, EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday applied another round of sanctions on Syria, due to the ''appalling violence'' there and discussed further support for Mr Annan's peace plan.
The new EU sanctions, to take effect  today, add 129 people and 43 firms or utilities to an asset freeze and travel ban.
In some of the worst violence seen since the conflict erupted, twin suicide bombings in Damascus on Thursday killed 55 people and wounded 372.
The Syrian opposition insisted Assad's government carried out the devastating attacks. But Russia's foreign ministry pointed the finger of blame  squarely at Islamist extremists yesterday.
''For us it is absolutely clear that terrorist groups are behind this: al-Qaeda and those groups that work with al-Qaeda,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said.
