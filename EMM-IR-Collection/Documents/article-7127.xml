  <text>"At 2am we heard two shells fall and the sound of tanks moving around the   streets," said Manhal Abu Bakr, an activist and citizen journalist.
"There is no gunfire now. They shell us at night so that it is hard to film,"   he said over Skype. Internet video footage, which Abu Bakr said was filmed   in Hama overnight, showed night-time explosions in a built-up area.
In Douma, a suburb of the capital Damascus, another activist said tanks were   still in the streets on Tuesday morning.
Turkey's prime minister accused Syria of infringing its border on Tuesday and   says his country is considering what steps to take in response, including   measures "we don't want to think about."
Recep Tayyip Erdogan was speaking to reporters during a visit to China, a day   after Syrian forces opened fire across the border, killing two people in a   refugee camp.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Erdogan as saying Turkey would assess   the situation and take steps accordingly.
Turkish authorities said on Monday that Syrian forces fired across the border   into a refugee camp in Turkey, wounding at least six people. But four   witnesses in the camp told The Associated Press that two people in the camp   also had been shot and killed.
Syria's foreign minister Walid Muallem was in Moscow on Tuesday for talks to   persuade Russia to maintain support for the Damascus regime.
Russia has been one of the very few world powers to offer some support to   Assad in his bloody standoff with protesters but has also backed the plan of   UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan to end the violence.
"There is the Annan plan. It contains concrete points and we fully support   this plan," the Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady   Gatilov as saying ahead of the talks on Monday.
Muallem, who arrived in Moscow late on Monday, was due to hold talks with   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov followed by a news conference later on   Tuesday.
Russia has repeatedly condemned the West for taking what it says is a   one-sided approach in the conflict but has in recent weeks shown signs of   growing exasperation with the intransigence of the Assad regime.
Moscow says its position is objective and gives it unmatched influence over   Damascus, although rights activists have accused Russia of giving a green   light to violence that has left more than 9,000 dead according to the UN.
