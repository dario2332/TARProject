Track events day by day in the region.
Police set fire to tents and vehicles in Tahrir Square, the focal point of the uprising that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak in February, before abruptly retreating late Sunday, allowing thousands of protesters to stream back into the central intersection.
Three people were killed and 192 people were injured in Sunday's clashes, according to the official state news agency.
Egypt's interim cabinet said it was determined to hold elections, set for Nov. 28, on schedule, blaming the unrest on "fabricated tension" that aimed to delay the vote.
The opposition appeared to be uniting against the military leadership, breathing new life into a youth-led protest movement that had grown moribund during the summer. A clearer set of demands began to emerge as protesters girded for a longer fight. Leading protest groups, such as the Revolutionary Youth Coalition and the 6th of April Youth Movement, say they intend to occupy the square until the military hands over power to a civilian authority.
The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, has managed such flareups, and survived condemnation over its handling of protests, since it assumed power from Mr. Mubarak. But the protests' timing so close to the country's first postrevolutionary parliamentary elections has raised the stakes.
The military now faces a critical decision: It could postpone elections and risk the wrath of politicians and some protesters; or hold polls under conditions that have become almost prohibitively unstable, activists and analysts say.
"It is quite problematic for [the military] to have elections and [for them] not to have elections," said Mustafa Kamal Al Sayyid, a political science professor at the American University in Cairo. "I think this is extremely unwise on the part of the military to do this," he said of the crackdown in Tahrir Square.
Sunday's uprising represents a renewed confluence of political demands between secular-minded protesters and Islamist politicians who command strong support from the Egyptian public. Both groups were instrumental in ousting Mr. Mubarak, but their paths diverged over the summer as Islamists chose a more accommodating position toward the military.
The tenuous relationship between the Islamists and the interim ruling military appeared to crumble on Friday, when tens of thousands of Islamists demonstrated against military rule in Tahrir Square.

The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, released a statement Sunday condemning the police violence, calling for calm, and demanding that authorities hold elections on time. A handful of liberal political candidates have said they would suspend campaigning as long as violence persists.
The violence began Saturday morning, when police moved into the central junction to clear remaining protesters following Friday's demonstration.

But by Saturday, the Islamists had been replaced by a different group of demonstrators.
The protesters who have spent the weekend fighting police officers in Tahrir Square bore a closer resemblance to the leaderless mass movement that dominated the 18-day uprising in late January and February.
Thousands of young people flooded the square on Saturday afternoon. The protests, while sparked by anger at the police, were soon joined by a diverse swath of Egyptians with a more unified message calling for the fall of the military regime.
Throughout Sunday, clashes continued at the eastern end of the square near the approach to Egypt's Ministry of Interior. Protesters threw rocks at police, who responded by firing tear gas and shooting rubber pellets.
Late on Sunday, demonstrators hoisted the body of one of their dead compatriots aloft and marched through Tahrir Square. "The people want the downfall of the field marshal!" the protesters chanted, referring to Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, head of the SCAF and the de facto president.
The courtyard of a nearby mosque, which served as a field hospital during the revolution in February, was filled with people lying on a dusty floor, awaiting treatment for injuries from serious wounds to minor exhaustion from tear gas. Doctors removed rubber pellets from protesters' faces and limbs.
The more serious cases were taken by medics to waiting ambulances. The flow of injured into the makeshift hospital at times overwhelmed volunteers who screamed for people to clear lanes in the crowded space.
"They beat us with sticks and with the butts of their weapons," said Mohamed Hassan, who identified himself as part of the 6th of April Youth Movement, one of the principal pro-democracy groups behind the earlier February revolution.
Both Mr. Hassan's arms were in slings. Police beatings had dislocated both his shoulders, he said. "The police and the soldiers threw a group of us down on the ground and pounded on us," he said. "I don't know why, but when I saw the army come in, I thought they would evict us without a beating. As you can see, I was wrong."
Taher Ismail, a resident of Giza, across the river from Cairo, said he saw live footage of the violence and immediately rushed to Tahrir "to stand with the people."
"I have no interest in politics or elections. I disagree with what [the SCAF] is doing to us," he said. "There's fighting that's worse than Jan. 28. But ours is a response, not a provocation," he said, referring to one of the most violent days in the revolution that toppled Mr. Mubarak.
He said he doubted the elections could be held as scheduled. "The revolution has begun all over again," Mr. Ismail said. "How are people going to go out and vote when people are dying over here?"
By Sunday afternoon, videos of the violence were circulating on social-networking sites. One in particular sparked outrage from bloggers, a video showing police dragging a man who appeared to be dead or unconscious onto a pile of trash.
"The protesters want to end the military regime. It's history repeating itself," said Ahmed Naguib, an activist who helped organize the Tahrir Square protests in February and is now running for Parliament as an independent. "If we're going to start all over again, with a clean start, then to hell with elections. We're already full of compromises."
Many of the protest's nominal leaders have embraced a plan for a civilian "National Rescue Government" that was first proposed by Nobel peace laureaute Mohamed ElBaradei, a former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a presidential candidate.
The Revolutionary Youth Coalition published a statement Saturday demanding an immediate transition to civilian rule.
"The idea is that we need a revolutionary government, a government that will really follow our demands," said Shadi Al Ghazali Harb, a leader in the Revolutionary Youth Coalition, a group formed in February. "If we just take a first step on taking the decision and choosing a powerful prime minister... the rest will be easier."
Mr. Al Ghazali Harb said many of the groups have agreed on Mr. ElBaradei as a strong candidate to be an interim prime minister who would lead the country toward presidential elections and the process of drafting a new constitution. Mr. Al Ghazali Harb, who is running for Parliament, said he hopes the elections will be held on time, though he distrusts the SCAF to lead the process.
"The elections are the only way for a constitution, so it should happen as soon as possible," he said. "That's why they should realize that this demand should be fulfilled as soon as possible so that we can get back the stability we're all looking for."
