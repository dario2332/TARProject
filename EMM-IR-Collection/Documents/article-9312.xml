Annan: Ceasefire in Syria Holding
GENEVA, (SANA) - The UN Special Envoy to Syria Kofi Annan said that the ceasefire in Syria appeared to be holding and should be sustained.
In a statement on Thursday, Annan added that "Syria is experiencing a rare moment of calm on the ground."
The statement said that "All sides have obligations to fully implement the six-point plan which includes both the military provisions of the plan and the commitment to move to a political process."
Annan called upon all Syrians to seize this opportunity, expressing satisfaction over the news about that the situation in Syria is relatively calm as all sides are committed to the ceasefire.
He added that he will ask the UN Security Council to agree on sending a ceasefire monitoring mission as soon as possible which will help quick launch of serious political dialogue which takes into account the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people.
