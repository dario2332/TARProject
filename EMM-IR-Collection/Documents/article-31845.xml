  <text>The council called the violence outrageous and once again demanded that the Syrian government halt violence in all forms. Those responsible for the violence should be held accountable, said the statement.
Syrian ambassador to the UN, Bashar Jaafari, said there was a slight exaggeration in terms of the involvement of the Syrian government in the mass killings.
"Neither [UN observer mission head Maj Gen Robert] Mood nor anybody else told the Security Council in the informal session that he would blame the Syrian government forces for what happened.
"It is really pitiful and regrettable that some members of the council came out just a few minutes after Gen Mood had finished his briefing to mislead you, to tell you lies about what happened," Jaafari said, according to the BBC.
Mood said the UN monitors who are on a mission on Syrian soil said: "[The monitors] viewed the bodies of the dead and confirmed from an examination of ordnance that artillery and tank shells were fired at a residential neighbourhood," reported Reuters as the opposition forces do not have artillery or tanks.
