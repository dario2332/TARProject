  <text>Special envoy Kofi Annan is to visit Damascus on Monday, the day after the UN condemned Syria for its use of heavy weaponry in the town of Houla, where at least 108 people were killed.
Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague is going to Russia, which views Syria as a vital ally in the region.
Russia and China have blocked previous attempts to impose UN sanctions on Syria.
This is a strong statement from a body that nearly always has to       compromise to reach agreement.
But diplomats stress that a political process is the best hope for progress.
Fighting in Syria has continued despite the deployment of some 280 UN observers monitoring a ceasefire brokered by Mr Annan.
Sunday saw thousands of activists take to the streets in protest at events in Houla.
On Sunday, the Security Council unanimously adopted the non-binding statement, calling for the Syrian government to withdraw its heavy weaponry from residential areas and return them to barracks.
"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest possible terms the killings... in the village of (Houla), near Homs, in attacks that involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighbourhood," the statement said.
"The members of the Security Council also condemned the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse," the statement continued.
Such outrageous use of force against civilian population constitutes a violation of applicable international law"
"Such outrageous use of force against civilian population constitutes a violation of applicable international law."
"Neither [UN observer mission head Maj Gen Robert] Mood nor anybody else told the Security Council in the informal session that he would blame the Syrian government forces for what happened.
"It is really pitiful and regrettable that some members of the council came out just a few minutes after Gen Mood had finished his briefing to mislead you, to tell you lies about what happened," he said.
Mr Jaafari said there had been deaths, but said they had been due to close-range assasinations rather than a result of shelling. Syria has blamed the massacre on "terrorists".
According to activists, Syrian troops used artillery to pound homes in Houla while pro-regime militia stormed the area, killing people on the streets and in their homes.
1. Syrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people
2. UN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians
3. All parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting, and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause
4. Authorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons
5. Authorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists
6. Authorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully
On a video link from Damascus, Maj-Gen Mood told the Security Council that 108 people had been killed and 300 injured in Houla - up from a previous figure of at least 90 dead.
The UN on Sunday also revised the number of children who died to 49, and said the casualties included 34 women.
Maj-Gen Mood told the BBC that UN monitors were continuing their investigations in Houla.
The meeting also comes after reports that a ship carrying Russian arms for the Syrian government arrived in Syria on Saturday were described as "credible" by Western diplomats.
The unrest in Syria has killed at least 10,000 people since protests against President Bashar al-Assad broke out in March 2011.
