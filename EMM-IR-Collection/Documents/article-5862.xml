  <text>The UN Security Council on Thursday called on Syria to "urgently" move to keep an April 10 deadline to withdraw troops and weapons from protest cities.
The 15-nation council, including Russia and China, agreed a statement putting new pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to end his offensive on protesters and opposition groups which the UN says has left at least 9,000 dead in the past year.
The council gave strong new backing to a peace plan by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, who says Syria has agreed an April 10 deadline to withdraw its troops and heavy weapons from main cities.
If this is carried out Annan will then give the government and opposition groups 48 hours to end all hostilities.
The Security Council statement "calls upon the Syrian government to implement urgently and visibly its commitments" made to Annan to take the steps toward a cessation of hostilities.
It calls for Syria to start a two hour daily pause in hostilities and to allow immediate humanitarian access.
The council said that depending on Annan's reports on what Assad has carried out, it will "consider further steps as appropriate."
The Security Council, which has been badly divided on Syria, gave its new boost to Annan's peace mission just before the special envoy briefed the UN General Assembly on his efforts to halt the government clampdown.
The statement was softened at Russia's demand however, diplomats involved in the talks said. Russia and China have vetoed two previous full resolutions on Syria.
An initial proposal by Western countries that the council "demands" that Syria pull back its troops and heavy weapons was changed to "calls" and "verifiably" was changed to "visibly."
Western nations have expressed deep skepticism that Syria will act on the deadline.
Diplomats said however that the council would face a new battle if Annan says that Syria has failed to keep the agreement and calls for UN sanctions. Russia and China are unlikely to agree any sanctions, they said.
