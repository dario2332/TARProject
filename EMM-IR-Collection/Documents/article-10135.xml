The German government is today looking into a report that weapons bound for the Syrian regime were loaded on to a German-owned ship.
Der Spiegel Weekly reported today that the Atlantic Cruiser was halted in the Mediterranean after its owners were warned it was suspected to be carrying Iranian military equipment to Tartus, Syria.
The newspaper quoted shipping agent Torsten Lueddeke, of Hamburg-based CEG Bulk Chartering, as saying: “We stopped the ship after we received information on the weapons cargo.”
He said the ship was chartered to Ukraine-based White Whale Shipping, and they said the ship was carrying pumps and similar equipment.
The German Economy Ministry said it looks into all suspected embargo breaches but does not yet have details of the case.
Agents for White Whale Shipping said the vessel was not carrying any dangerous or military cargo bound for Syria.
They added: “The only IMO/dangerous cargo on board was loaded in India for delivery to Turkey and Montenegro. These are the next ports of call of this vessel.
“All dangerous cargo on board is carried in line with international conventions and is fully supported by certificates of origin and other supporting documents.
“The Syria cargo on board this vessel has no relation to military, and was loaded in India, produced by a well-known Indian shipper of electricity-related products, and is going to be discharged in Iskenderun (Turkey) for further on-carrriage to Syria.”
