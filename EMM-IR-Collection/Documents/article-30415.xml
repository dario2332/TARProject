  <text>BEIRUT (Reuters) -- The death toll has risen to at least 90 people from shelling by Syrian government forces on the town of Houla  in central Homs  province, an opposition group said on Saturday.
There was no immediate independent confirmation of the account from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights from within Syria, which has restricted access for journalists during a 14-month-old revolt against President Bashar Assad.
Opposition activists said on Friday that Syrian forces opened fire with artillery after skirmishing with insurgents in Houla, a cluster of villages north of the city of Homs.
Various opposition activists put the death toll at over 50 by late on Friday. Footage posted to web sites showed bloodied and mangled corpses described as the victims of the shelling
Houla is a cluster of four villages and towns north of Homs.
Meanwhile, a Russian cargo ship loaded with weapons is en route to Syria  and due to arrive at a Syrian port this weekend, Al Arabiya television said in a report that Western diplomats in New York described on Friday as credible.
Syria is one of Russia's top weapons customers. The United States and European Union have suggested the UN Security Council should impose an arms embargo and other UN sanctions on Syria for its 14-month assault on a pro-democracy opposition determined to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Russia, with the support of fellow veto power China, has prevented the council from imposing any UN sanctions on Syria and has refused to halt arms sales to Damascus.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said it did not have information that a ship was headed to Tartus with weapons and declined further comment.
US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was asked about the Al Arabiya report at her daily briefing in Washington.
"I had not seen that report," she told reporters. "You know how strongly we feel that no country should be delivering weapons to the Assad regime now."
UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan has also urged countries not to supply weapons to either side in the conflict. Annan plans to visit Damascus soon, his spokesman said on Friday.
