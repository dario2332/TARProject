  <text>The statement also repeated a call for the government to immediately withdraw heavy weapons from Syrian towns in line with Annan's peace plan.
Earlier on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed the Syria conflict with visiting British Foreign Secretary William Hague in Moscow. Speaking at a joint press conference, Lavrov said both Assad's government and rebels were to blame for the Houla massacre.
"We are dealing with a situation in which both sides evidently had a hand in the deaths of innocent people," Lavrov said. He added that he and Hague had agreed that pressure must be brought to bear on both sides to end the violence.
Hague stressed that both Britain and Russia supported Annan's peace plan as it was "at the moment the only hope" for putting an end to the crisis.
In Syria itself on Monday there was no sign of an end to the violence.
There were deadly clashes in several provinces including Idlib in the northwest and Daraa in the south, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Demonstrators took to the streets in towns and villages across the country to protest against the massacre at Houla and the bombardment of the city of Hama, allegedly carried out by Syrian troops. The Observatory said 34 people were killed when Hama was subjected to random shelling by government troops on Sunday.
The government has denied any involvement in the Houla massacre.
"No Syrian tank or artillery entered this place where the massacres were committed," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told reporters in Damascus. "The soldiers didn't leave their places because they were in a state of self-defense."
Like most reports coming out of Syria during this conflict, it is virtually impossible to independently verify the events that happened in Houla and Hama, due to severe restrictions on foreign journalists working in the country.
The UN-Arab League envoy is in Syria to try to rescue his plan to end more than a year of fighting in the country. Even as Kofi Annan arrived in Damascus though, the violence continued unabated.
