  <text>AFP - Domenico Criscito will not be part of Italy's Euro 2012 squad following his implication in the "Calcioscommesse" match-fixing scandal, Italian federation vice-president Demetrio Albertini said Monday.
Criscito was handed a notice of indictment in a dawn raid on Monday in which his hotel room at Italy's pre-tournament base near Florence was searched by police.
Italy coach Cesare Prandelli was due to announce his 23-man squad on Monday and Albertini has confirmed Criscito will not be a part of it.
