  <text>At least 58 people died when twin blasts ripped through Afghan shrines on the Shiite holy day of Ashura on Tuesday. A massive suicide attack in Kabul targeted a crowd of worshippers at a riverside shrine killing 54 people alone in the deadliest strike on the city in three years.
The second attack took place in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Both come a day after an international meeting in Germany aimed at charting a course for Afghanistan 10 years after US-led forces drove the Taliban from power.
Pakistan and the Taliban - both seen as pivotal to ending Afghanistan's long war - boycotted the talks, undermining already modest hopes for progress.
Nato has condemned the attacks while the Taliban did not claim responsibility and instead denounced them as "inhumane" and blamed the bloodshed on the "invading enemy".
The Shia Muslim festival of Ashura is the most important day in the Shia calendar and a public holiday in Afghanistan.
