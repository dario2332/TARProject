  <text>A car bomb attack at a police station in Turkey today killed the driver and a police officer, Turkish media reported.
Broadcaster NTV said the bomber had tried to drive his car into the police station in the central province of Kayseri moments before the blast took place. At least 19 people were wounded in the attack, six of them seriously, other media reported.
NTV said a second assailant was also involved in the incident in the town of Pinarbasi east of Kayseri city. Kayseri province is located some 325km southeast of the Turkish capital Ankara.
Kurdish separatists, Islamist militants, including al-Qaeda, as well as groups on the far left and right have all carried out bomb attacks in Turkey, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Hasan Gumus, a civil servant at the Pinarbasi district governor's office said he heard the blast from his office two kilometres away. "We saw a big cloud of smoke rising, but we don't know about the number of dead or injured," he said.
