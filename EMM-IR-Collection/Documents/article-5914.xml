  <text>The UN Security Council has urged Syria to implement "urgently and visibly" a peace plan requiring a 10 April deadline for ending a military offensive against the opposition.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the conflict was getting worse.
Mr Annan urged both sides to seize the moment and end the violence.
"Let us stop the killing and start a serious political dialogue," he told the UN General Assembly.
He said he expected a full ceasefire to take effect by 06:00 (03:00 GMT) on 12 April.

Mr Annan is expected travel to Iran on 11 April, the day after the partial ceasefire is due, to try to win further regional support for his peace plan.
The UN statement requested that Mr Annan provide proposals for a mechanism to supervise the ceasefire and update the Security Council on the cessation of violence and implementation of the peace plan.
The Security Council said it would consider further steps depending on the outcome of these reports.
Speaking later to the General Assembly by video link from Geneva, Mr Annan said he was urging the government and opposition to "issue clear instructions so that the message reaches across the country, down to the fighter and soldier at the local level".
1. Syrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people
2. UN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians
3. All parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting, and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause
4. Authorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons
5. Authorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists
6. Authorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully
He said that if the ceasefire was successful a small mobile UN monitoring mission of some 200-250 observers could be brought into Syria.
Syria had already reported some troop withdrawals from three cities, Mr Annan said, but the violence was still continuing.
"Alarming levels of casualties and other abuses continue to be reported daily. Military operations in civilian population centres have not stopped."
Activists reported on Thursday that government forces had been shelling several towns, including Homs, Deraa and the Douma suburb of Damascus.
"The situation on the ground continues to deteriorate."
Meanwhile the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that Syrian officials had agreed to it having an "expanded presence" in the country.
The UN says the conflict has cost more than 9,000 lives since it began a year ago. The Syrian government blames violence on "terrorist gangs" and says some 3,000 members of the security forces have been killed.
Foreign media face severe restrictions on reporting in Syria, and it is hard to verify the claims of either side.
Arab League leaders meeting in Baghdad say they want to end the violence in Syria but are unable to agree on how to do it
Syrian troops launch fresh assaults on rebels, activists say, as a UN envoy travels to Damascus to discuss implementing a peace plan.
