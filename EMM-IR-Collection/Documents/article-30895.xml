  <text>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN-Arab League special envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, condemned on Saturday in the strongest possible terms, the killing of over 92 people and the wounding of hundreds more in the village of El-Houleh, near Homs.
Activists said there was an artillery barrage by government forces, in the worst violence since the start of a UN peace plan to slow the flow of blood in Syria's uprising.
"This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms. Those responsible for perpetrating this crime must be held to account," the UN secretary general and special envoy said in a joint statement.
They demanded "the government of Syria immediately cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers," and extended their sympathies to the families of the victims and to the wounded.
The bloodied bodies of children, some with their skulls split open, were shown in footage posted to YouTube purporting to show the victims of the shelling in the central town of Houla on Friday. The sound of wailing filled the room.
The carnage underlined just how far Syria is from any negotiated path out of the 14-month-old revolt against President Bashar Assad.
"This morning UN military and civilian observers went to Houla and counted more than 32 children under the age of 10 and over 60 adults killed," the head of UN team monitoring the ceasefire - which has yet to take hold - said.
"The observers confirmed from examination of ordinances the use of artillery tank shells," Major General Robert Mood said in a statement, without elaborating. "Whoever started, whoever responded and whoever carried out this deplorable act of violence should be held responsible."
