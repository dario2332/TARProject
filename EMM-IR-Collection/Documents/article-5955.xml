  <text>The UN Security Council has endorsed an April 10 deadline for the Syrian regime to halt fighting and withdraw its forces from towns and cities.
The statement raises the possibility of "further steps" being considered if the Syrian government fails to comply.
Syrian activists say violence has intensified in many areas of the country despite the regime's pledge to abide by the ceasefire brokered by the UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
A major offensive is reported to be under way in the Damascus suburb of Douma where government forces are said to be using heavy weapons.
Artillery has also been used in civilian areas of Homs where residents say several children have been killed.
Activists say at least 40 people have been killed across the country.
The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has told the General Assembly that there is no sign that the regime is implementing the ceasefire.
"Despite the Syrian government's acceptance of the joint special envoy's (Mr Annan's) plan of initial proposals to resolve the crisis, the violence and assaults in civilian areas have not stopped. The situation on the ground continues to deteriorate," Mr Ban said.
Syria's regime has told Mr Annan that it has started to withdraw its forces from three areas - Idlib, Zabadani and Deraa - but that has been disputed by local activists and the UN has not yet verified the reports.
A "planning team" from the UN has arrived in Damascus ahead of the expected deployment of between 200 and 250 unarmed troops as monitors to observe the ceasefire, which is part of Mr Annan's six-point peace plan.
Rebel forces will be urged to halt their attacks within 48 hours of the Tuesday deadline for the government forces to withdraw from populated areas.
The UN Security Council statement calls on the Syrian government to "implement urgently and visibly" its commitments.
Syrian President Bashar al Assad pledged to abide by the deadline but Western nations are sceptical. A previous ceasefire deal, brokered by the Arab League, was flouted by the government despite the presence of Arab League monitors.
Russia and China did not oppose the Security Council statement but have made it clear they will not back any further action against Syria including sanctions.
