The United Nations Security Council last night condemned theSyrian government "in the strongest possible terms" forheavy-weapon attacks on the town of Houla, where 108 people, and upto 34 children, were killed on Friday.
While the carefully worded statement stopped short of blaming
anyone for the "close-range attacks" that killed many of the
victims, the Council condemned "the killing of civilians by
shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse".
The statement said the "outrageous use of force" against
civilians violated international law and government commitments to
cease violence, including the use of heavy weapons. The Syrian
government denies responsibility for the massacre.
The Foreign Secretary, William Hague, was expected to ask
Russia, Syria's only remaining major foreign ally, to put pressure
on the regime to stop the killings. Kofi Annan, the UN-Arab League
envoy, was also due for talks in Damascus.
Mr Hague said he was "absolutely sickened" by the recent deaths
in Syria. "It is a familiar tactic of the Assad regime to blame
others for what's happening in their country to try to get out of
responsibility for the scale of the destruction," he said. The
deaths "illuminate the type of tyranny that the people in Syria
have been experiencing".
Mr Hague is due in Moscow today and is expected to urge the
Russian Foreign Minister to take a much tougher stance over the
human-rights abuses committed by the Assad regime. Russia and China
have been the main opponents of stronger action against the Syrian
"It isn't in the interests of Russia, it's not in anyone's
interests, for Syria to descend into an even bloodier situation and
into a full-scale civil war, and that's now the danger," Mr Hague
Diplomats say Britain and France had proposed issuing a press
statement condemning the killings, but Russia told Council members
it could not agree and wanted to be briefed first by Major-General
Robert Mood, who is heading the UN observer mission in Syria. Syria
is once more facing diplomatic isolation. Mr Annan is due back in
Damascus today for talks aimed at rescuing his foundering peace
plan, which was agreed seven weeks ago.
The Syrian government denies its forces were responsible for the
killings at Houla. But it has not produced a credible alternative
explanation of what happened there to cast doubt on the claims of
the opposition, largely confirmed by UN-ceasefire monitors, that
the slaughter of at least 34 children and their parents was carried
out by pro-government forces.
To survive, President Bashar al-Assad needs to avoid the
international isolation which befell Libya. He also needs to
prevent Syrians, and the world, from believing the fall of his
regime is inevitable and they should avoid betting on a loser.
"How will Russia respond to this?" asked one foreign diplomat in
Damascus yesterday. "That is the crucial question." Russia remains
Syria's most important friend. It was Russian and Chinese vetoes at
the UN Security Council in February that relieved Syria from the
danger of foreign intervention similar to that which overthrew
Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.
But Russia is paying a price for backing Syria, and this price
will have been raised by the Houla killings. It may not want to be
allied to a regime in a permanent state of crisis.
President Assad can look for longer-term support to Iran and, to
a lesser extent, Iraq, both Shia powers. They see Syria as being
targeted by the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The Iranians have been giving some economic aid to reduce the
impact of sanctions. Hezbollah in Lebanon will also be loath to see
its long-term ally in Syria go down. But the Iranians, whose
foreign policy is normally cautious and devious, will not want to
depend on the survival of President Assad. They will look for an
accommodation with any successor government, though Iran still
faces a serious strategic defeat. It will be losing its one
important ally in the Arab world. It will lose much of its ability
to play a role as a regional power.
The Syrian chargé d'affaires will be summoned to the Foreign
Office today to hear Britain's condemnation of the Houla massacre,
which the Syrian government denies.
Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: "The scenes of
savagery that we have seen on our television screens are revolting,
stomach-churning." Mr Clegg and Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office
minister, warned that Syrian officials may not be allowed into
London for the Olympics.
Mowaffak Joumma, the chairman of the Syrian Olympic committee,
last night said the Olympic charter forbade host nations from
banning athletes. "Authority of any host country is limited to
organising and offering all necessary facilities to all
participating athletes," he said.
