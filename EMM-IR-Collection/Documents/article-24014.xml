  <text>Hariri tells Akkar residents not to be dragged into strife
Future Movement leader MP Saad Hariri condemned the killing of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahid and his bodyguard and called on Akkar residents to not allow themselves to be dragged into strife.
“I call on Akkar residents to maintain calm and not [allow themselves to be] dragged into the trap [that aims to cause] strife,” Hariri said in a statement issued by his press office.
Hariri also said that the Future Movement and the Future bloc will not stop calling for holding accountable  “the [army] members who opened fire and the [members] who gave orders to open fire.”
The former premier said that he did not hold the entire army responsible for the “murder,” adding, however, that there were “some [members] involved in the [murder] and who aim to [use] the [military] institution to import the crisis of the Syrian regime to Lebanon.”
Hariri also warned that there was a “scheme” aiming to harm Lebanese areas by “causing problems in them” that serve the Syrian regime and “its tools,” and called on Akkar residents to not be dragged into “reactions that transfer chaos to their city.”
The former premier also commended Abdel Wahid saying he “was known for his patriotism and his [positions] supporting what is rightful. This was shown [through] his stance [calling] for justice in the [case] of former premier Rafik Hariri as well his stance standing by the Syrian people in their struggle against the [Syrian] regime.”
The statement also said that Hariri contacted Abdel Wahid’s family and offered his condolences, adding that he also contacted President Michel Sleiman and Lebanese army commander General Jean Kahwaji and called for an “immediate investigation” into the murder of Abdel Wahid.
The NNA reported earlier on Sunday that an “armed convoy” carrying Abdel Wahid to the northern Lebanese town of Halba to participate in a rally refused to stop at a Lebanese army checkpoint in Akkar. According to the report, the Lebanese army opened fire when the convoy failed to stop, which led to the death of Abdel Wahid and a bodyguard identified as Mohammad Hussein Merheb, both from the town of Al-Beri.-NOW Lebanon
