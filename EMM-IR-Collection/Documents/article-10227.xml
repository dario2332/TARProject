  <text>The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously passed its first resolution on the Syria crisis, allowing an advance party of ceasefire monitors to go to the country on the brink of civil war.
UN Resolution 2042 approved the first 30 unarmed military monitors, who UN officials said could leave for Damascus within hours. The resolution also calls upon the Syrian government to "implement visibly" all commitments under special envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan -- including the withdrawal of all troops and heavy guns from Syrian cities.
The vote had been expected on Friday but was held up by Russian objections to much of the text. Russia's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said that "substantive changes" had been made to make it "more balanced." Russia and China vetoed two previous attempts by the 15-nation council to pass a resolution on the crisis which the UN says has left well over 9,000 dead.
A new resolution with a full mandate will be required for the full monitoring mission of more than 200 observers. The resolution called on President Bashar al-Assad and the opposition "to guarantee the safety of the advance team without prejudice to its freedom of movement and access." It "stresses" that "primary responsibility" for the observers' safety rests with the Syrian government.
France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud said sending the advanced mission would "test whether Syria is serious about its engagements" before authorizing the full mission. He said attacks by government forces on civilians in Homs on Saturday had raised "some doubt" about the intentions of Assad's government.
All western envoys raised doubts about whether Assad would stick to the ceasefire started on Saturday and keep to commitments made to Annan.	   The resolution comes "only after the Syrian people have over one year suffered unimaginable brutality at the hands of a regime which has prioritized its own survival," said Britain's UN envoy Mark Lyall Grant.
Russia's envoy, Churkin, said the observers are "facing a difficult challenge. They will need a high degree of professionalism, courage and objectivity." The Security Council ordered UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to report by Thursday on the initial work of the monitors and by Wednesday give recommendations for deploying the full mission.
Meanwhile, Germany said on Saturday it was investigating the possible breaking of an arms embargo after a report claiming that a German ship had been carrying Iranian weapons bound for Syria. The news weekly Der Spiegel reported on Saturday on its website that a German shipping company stopped one of its vessels on the high seas after a tip-off from opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
The Atlantic Cruiser, owned by Emden-based Bockstiegel but leased by a Ukrainian firm called White Whale Shipping, had loaded the arms in Djibouti, where they had been brought by an Iranian vessel, according to the weekly's report. It said the Atlantic Cruiser was halted 80-km from the Syrian port of Tartus on Friday.
"We had been told that the cargo contained pumps and other machinery of that sort," the magazine quoted Torsten Lueddeke of freight handlers CEG Bulk Chartering as saying.
Iran is under a UN arms embargo imposed in 2007 because of its nuclear activities while Western countries have declared a similar embargo against Iranian ally Syria since its bloody crackdown on dissent began over a year ago. It was not clear what had happened to the Atlantic Cruiser. At one stage it was headed for the Turkish port of Iskunderun, Der Spiegel said.
