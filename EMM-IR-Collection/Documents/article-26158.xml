  <text>DAMASCUS: Syrian security forces carried out a spate of raids in Damascus early Tuesday after a deadly bombing hit the capital and U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon warned the search for peace was at a "pivotal moment."
State television said the blast hit a restaurant in the Qaboun neighborhood of the capital. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five people were killed.
In all, at least 59 people were killed nationwide on Monday, including 31 loyalist troops who died in clashes with rebel fighters, the Observatory said.
The bloodshed raged despite the deployment of a U.N. military observer mission to oversee a promised ceasefire that has been breached daily since it went into force on April 12.
The Observatory said dozens of people were arrested in the pre-dawn raids in several suburbs of the capital, including Douma, Harasta and Barzen.
It said powerful blasts were heard overnight in a number of provincial cities, including central Hama, northern Aleppo and the coastal cities of Banias and Latakia.
The watchdog said there were also fierce clashes between regime forces and rebels in the town of Kfar Roma in Idlib province in the northwest.
One person was also killed by gunfire in Nouaymeh, a town in the southern province of Daraa, the watchdog said.
"The secretary general said we were at a pivotal moment in the search for a peaceful settlement to the crisis and that he remained extremely troubled about the risk of an all-out civil war," a spokesman for Ban said at a NATO summit in Chicago on Monday.
"We strongly condemn the behavior of the Syrian security forces and their crackdowns on the Syrian population," NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Sunday.
"But again NATO has no intention to intervene in Syria."
NATO states have come under criticism for backing the air war in Libya but ruling out military intervention in Syria, where opposition demonstrators and badly outgunned rebels have been hammered by heavily-armed regime forces.
U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous urged authorities in the flashpoint central city of Homs to release political prisoners and allow "peaceful demonstrations" to be held.
Homs has been hard hit by deadly clashes between protesters and security forces. Last week, at least 15 civilians were "summarily executed" in the city by regime forces, according to the Observatory.
