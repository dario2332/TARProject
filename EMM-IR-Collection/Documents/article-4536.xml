BEIRUT &amp;mdash; Syrian troops began  pulling out Tuesday from some calm cities and headed back to their bases  a week ahead of a deadline to implement an international cease-fire  plan, a government official said.
The claim could not immediately  be verified and activists near the capital Damascus denied troops were  leaving their area. They said the day regime forces withdraw from  streets, Syria will witness massive protests that will overthrow the  government.
Khaled al-Omar, an activist in the Damascus suburb of Saqba, denied that any withdrawal was under way in his area.
Earlier  in the day, opposition activists charged that the regime was racing to  crush opponents ahead of the cease-fire deadline by carrying out intense  raids, arrests and shelling on Tuesday.
Western  leaders have cautiously accepted the April 10 deadline while pointing  out that Assad has broken previous promises and insisting the regime  must be judged by its actions.
The Syrian government  has not commented publicly on the April 10 deadline. It has accepted  other peace plans in recent months only to ignore them on the ground. An  Arab League effort that included sending in monitors to promote a  cease-fire collapsed in violence in November.
It also remains  unclear whether rebel forces fighting government troops under the banner  of the Free Syrian Army would respect a cease-fire. Dozens of local  militias in different parts of the country have only loose links to each  other and to their official leadership in Turkey.
