  <text>Prime Minister Najib Mikati chaired a ministerial and security meeting at the Grand Serail on Sunday following the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard and said the cabinet was committed to addressing the issue via a “disciplinary and criminal procedure.”
“What is [very] painful is that a force from the Lebanese army [was involved] in this incident, which [happened under] unfortunate circumstances that must be clarified through the investigation that the relevant judicial military [body] is handling,” Mikati said.
He added that the relevant judicial military body handling the investigation will take the “appropriate measures against those who will be proven to have been involved [in the incident],” the premier added.
He also said that Akkar residents “cannot consider the Lebanese army as their rival,” adding that the army as well “cannot deal with its sons in Akkar in a hostile [manner] because it was concerned with their stability and security.”
“Lebanese security bodies cannot be working against a [certain] Lebanese party or implementing the will of [a certain party]. If some mistakes happen when security operations are being conducted, the judiciary will [address them].”
Mikati also said that “targeting security bodies through political campaigns yields negative results.”
“I call on my brothers in Akkar and Tripoli to not allow Lebanon’s enemies to achieve their goals [to harm Lebanon], and I confirm to them that the cabinet and I will pursue the investigation [of Abdel Wahed’s murder] until the end.”
The premier also called for reopening roads that some residents had blocked in some northern areas.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed.
