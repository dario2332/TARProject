  <text>UN probe: Bodies pictured piled up in Syria, as released by the opposition's Shaam News Network
A later video showed the bodies, wrapped in white sheets, being placed in a sprawling mass grave.
Mood told the Security Council that UN observers at the scene now estimate 108 people were killed in Houla, UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous told reporters outside the council chamber. 
The UN counted 49 children and 34 women among the dead. Activists from the Houla area said the army pounded the villages with artillery and clashed with local rebels after protests Friday.
Some activists said pro-regime thugs later stormed the area, doing the bulk of the killing by gunning down men in the streets and stabbing women and children in their homes.
The Syrian government rejected that narrative Sunday, painting a vastly different picture.
Syrian officials linked to the slaughter of civilians will be barred from visiting London for the Olympics, Nick Clegg said yesterday.
The Deputy Prime Minister said new rules allowed the Home Office to bar anyone suspected of serious human rights abuses from entering the country.
Speaking to reporters in Damascus, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said Syrian security forces were in their local bases Friday when they were attacked by 'hundreds of heavily armed gunmen' firing mortars, heavy machine guns and anti-tank missiles, staring a nine-hour battle that killed three soldiers and wounded 16.
The soldiers fought back, but didn't leave their bases, he said.
He said: 'No Syrian tank or artillery entered this place where the massacres were committed.
'The security forces did not leave their places because they were in a state of self-defence.'
He blamed the gunmen for what he called a 'terrorist massacre' in Houla and accused the media, Western officials and others of spinning a 'tsunami of lies' to justify foreign intervention in Syria.
Makdissi did not provide videos or other evidence to support his version of events, nor did he give a death toll. He said the government had formed a committee to investigate and share its findings with Annan, who is due to visit Damascus in the coming days.
Throughout the uprising, the government has deployed snipers, troops and thugs to quash protests and shelled opposition areas.
A video released by the UN team in Syria on Sunday showed observers in Houla the day after the attack, meeting with local rebels and watching residents collect more bodies for burial.
It also showed two destroyed armored personnel carriers - suggesting that local rebels put up more of a fight than the activists acknowledged.

Horror: The UN counted 49 children and 34 women among the dead. Activists from the Houla area said the army pounded the villages with artillery and clashed with local rebels after protests Friday
In a letter to the Security Council, Ban said villages in the Houla area have been outside government control but surrounded by a heavy Syrian military presence.
When UN observers visited the area on Saturday, Ban said they saw 85 corpses in a mosque in Taldou and 'observed shotgun wounds and wounds consistent with artillery fire'.
He said 'the patrol also saw artillery and tank shells, as well as fresh tank tracks' and observed that 'many buildings had been destroyed by heavy weapons'.
At UN headquarters, Russia's deputy UN ambassador Alexander Pankin told reporters as he headed into the closed-door Security Council meeting 'there is substantial ground to believe that the majority of those who were killed were either slashed, cut by knives, or executed at point-blank distance'.
'We have to establish whether it was Syrian authorities ... before we agree on something,' he said.
Appalled: Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was 'sickened' by the massacre of children
A press statement is weaker than a presidential statement, which becomes part of the council record, or a legally binding U.N. resolution.
But it must be approved by all 15 members and therefore reflects strong Security Council backing.
Annan's peace plan for Syria, sponsored by the UN and the Arab League, is one of the few points of agreement among world powers about Syria's crisis, which began in March 2011 with protests calling for political change.
As the government violently cracked down on the uprising, many in the opposition took up arms to defend themselves and attack government troops.
The UN put the death toll weeks ago at more than 9,000. Hundreds more have been killed since then.
Daily violence has marred the plan since a cease-fire was supposed to begin April 12. The Houla attack made Friday the deadliest day since the truce was announced, and has cast a shadow over Annan's visit.
In another defiant move, Syria on Sunday denied permission for Annan's deputy to travel to Damascus with his boss, a senior Arab League official said.
The rejection of former Palestinian Foreign Minister Nasser al-Kidwa was intended as a slap to the Arab League, which suspended Syria's membership and approved sanctions against it last year.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Annan's spokesman declined to comment.
The Houla attacks caused outrage among American and international officials that Makdissi's comments Sunday failed to assuage.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he would summon Syria's most senior diplomat in the UK today so the Foreign Office could 'make clear our condemnation of the Syrian regime's actions'.

Kuwait, which currently heads the 22-member Arab League, called for an Arab ministerial meeting to 'take steps to put an end to the oppressive practices against the Syrian people'.
Switzerland's Foreign Ministry urged that an international inquiry be convened, saying the killings 'could constitute a war crime'.
In Paris, the head of the exile Syrian National Council also condemned the killings.
'The kids of Houla are the kids of all of Syria,' Burhan Ghalioun told reporters. 'Killing the kids of Houla is like killing the kids of all of Syria.'
Anti-regime activists scoffed at the government's version of events. One Houla activist said via Skype that the area had at most 300 fighters, but that none had more than rifles and that they often lacked ammunition.
'If we had anti-tank missiles, there would be no tanks left in the area,' said Mohammed.
Activists reported shelling, gunfire and arrest raids in opposition areas throughout the country Sunday as well as clashes between regime forces and rebels in a number of areas.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces killed at least 14 civilians, while rebels killed nine soldiers.
Activist claims could not be independently verified. The Syrian government bars most media from operating in the country.
Annan's plan calls for eventual talks between all sides on a political solution to the crisis.
The U.S. hopes Russia can use its influence with Damascus to press for a political transition similar to that seen in Yemen.
In February, longtime Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh passed power to his deputy in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
U.S. officials say Russia does not oppose a political transition in Syria in theory, but has not agreed to specific terms.

No doubt this is the work of the so-called "rebels" &amp; as sure as night follows day our stupid politicians fall for it. All lining up as if on cue to parrot the same line "it's all Assad's doing".Can't they see that this has the CIA's dirty fingerprints all over it? Haven't we been here before? Wise up , everyone, the men in grey suits who really run the world have started upping the ante in Syria, trying their damnest to soften us all up for another invasion, leading all the way to all-out war with Iran, the consequences of which don't bear thinking about.

Why do we not do anything about Syria? this is a country i think we could all get behind removing the powers that be! lets face it iraq was for oil libya was revenge on gadafi, Syria we have to watch children die pretty much on or tv screens and yet because theres nothing in it for us we do nothing about it. Im not calling on us to go o war, just make it a fair fight give the oppostion a fighting chance.

Can we now see photos of the thousands of children Bliar &amp; Bush murdered in Iraq when our subs lay offshore and fired hundreds of cruise missiles into the country?

Dont understand the point of the UN, apart from condemning the Syrian regime they dont do anything what are they there for?

Nothing is more calculated to instill hatred for a regime than the murder of innocent children. In World War I cartoons and early movies depicted the 'barbarian Huns' bayonetting babies. A wave of anti-German hysteria swept through Britain. Subsequently it was admitted that many of the atrocities were fake, the invention of a British government propaganda agency. A similar untruthful campaign was employed during the first Gulf War when it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had ripped babies from Kuwait incubators. The latest images from Syria are indeed shocking but it is still not clear whether these deaths were the result of an action by government troops or whether the atrocities were committed by insurgents taking revenge upon Assad loyalists and cynically employing the images to further their own agenda.

Im glad the DM has refrained from using the images on the front header as yesteday the top image was used on this topic with zero warning on the front as i find picture of dead people with no warning particularly upsetting. A dreadful story.

i really don't understand why so many people find it impossible to believe that the syrian government forces are committing these atrocities...red arrow me all you like, but to say there's no strategic gain for us, so there's no point getting involved is disgusting...it's easy for people to say such things, sitting behind their computer, in a country made safe by other people risking their lives...if it were your children caught in a crossfire, their throats being slit and hunted down like animals, would you be so quick to say that it isn't the business of other nations, that they shouldn't try to help you? As for the conspiracy theorists out in force again, i would recommend that you watch a very funny, and accurate episode of south park (season 10, episode 9)...one-fourth of people really are stupid...as for the rebels being blood thirsty thugs...i believe that accusation should be levelled at the 'men' who wielded the guns and knives that spilt so much blood...

I am sure Assad is shaking in his boots knowing the UN condemns the massacre...next step is sending in the elite UN Teletubbie Commandoes to rectify the situation.

This is an internal ARAB problem.
Why are we being drawn into it?
