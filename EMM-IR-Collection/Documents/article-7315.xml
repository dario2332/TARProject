  <text>Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has failed to send the required "signal of peace," UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan told the UN Security Council on Tuesday.
The Syrian army continued "rolling military operations" against civilian targets in the days ahead of a Tuesday deadline to get guns and troops out of Syrian cities, Annan said in a letter to the council obtained by AFP.
Syrian government forces withdrew from some cities before the deadline but now have new targets, he added.
"The days before April 10 could have been an opportunity for the government of Syria to send a powerful political signal of peace," Annan said. "In the last five days it has become clear that such a signal has yet to be issued."
He said a "fundamental change of course" was needed by Assad to achieve a ceasefire in the next 48 hours.
Western nations have already said that Assad has failed to keep his commitment to the Annan peace plan.
