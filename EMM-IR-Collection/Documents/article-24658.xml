Protesters clashed with riot police Sunday as an anti-NATO protest turned ugly in Chicago when a few hundred demonstrators demanding an end to war ignored orders to clear the streets.
As NATO leaders held talks focused on Afghanistan, officials said up to 2,200 people had marched in the city, but later some protesters faced off with baton-wielding police.
An AFP correspondent saw more than a dozen protesters roughly shoved to the street, handcuffed and hauled away as the angry crowd threw water bottles, wooden sticks and anything else to hand at police clad in riot gear.
News crews captured images of protesters bleeding from head wounds, but officials would not provide information about the number of protesters injured.
Police said 45 people were arrested as of 9 p.m. and four police officers suffered minor injuries.
A tight security blanket has been thrown over Chicago, the hometown of US President Barack Obama, which is hosting more than 50 world leaders for the two-day summit.
While police were able to eventually disperse the protesters gathered near the summit, the crowd simply shifted to the central business district where noisy scuffles continued as darkness fell.
The hours-long standoff began after an otherwise peaceful march led by a group of veterans who spoke passionately about their opposition to the war before tossing their medals into the street.
Peter Andamczak, 27, hand-rolled his wheelchair for miles because he thinks money being wasted on wars would be better spent on social services.
Police began to move in to clear the streets after the speakers wrapped up, but a core group of several hundred protesters refused to leave.
Tensions grew after several black-clad youth were dragged away by police.
Fears of violent demonstrations have put Chicago on edge, with some downtown businesses boarding up their windows and others telling office workers to ditch their suits and ties to avoid being hassled.
Police and protest organizers had vowed that there will be no repeat of the trouble that erupted at G20 summits in London and Toronto or the riots that scarred Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
