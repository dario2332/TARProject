Global leaders on Tuesday accused Syria of failing to begin implementing a ceasefire deal as regime forces pounded protest hubs on the deadline day, with 28 civilians among more than 50 people killed.
The U.N. Security Council called on President Bashar al-Assad to keep a Thursday deadline for a complete ceasefire in the Syria conflict, after his forces and heavy weapons did not pull back from key cities in the crackdown.
Syria said it was abiding by the deal, but U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan accused it of pulling troops from some areas and moving them elsewhere.
At the same time, the rebel Free Syrian Army warned it would resume attacks if the government offensive does not stop.
In a statement read by U.S. ambassador Susan Rice, the Security Council backed a demand by U.N.-Arab League envoy Annan for Syria to make a “fundamental change of course” to end hostilities by 6:00 am Damascus time on Thursday.
After Annan appealed for new U.N. backing, council members expressed “deep concern” at the Syrian government’s failure to withdraw its forces and “stressed the importance that the parties meet the deadline of April 12.”
Council members also “underscored” Annan’s statement that “the Syrian leadership should now seize the opportunity to make a fundamental change of course,” Rice said.
“It is essential that the next 48 hours bring visible signs of immediate and indisputable change in the military posture of the government forces throughout the country” as set out in Annan’s six-point plan.
Washington said it hoped the Security Council would consider action if Annan concludes that Damascus broke its commitment on Tuesday’s deadline.
In Moscow, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem claimed Damascus had begun carrying out the deal by withdrawing some troops out of certain provinces.
But Annan, visiting Syrian refugees in Turkey, said that while the army had indicated it was withdrawing from some areas he had received reports of troops moving into other parts of the country.
“I again appeal to the Syrian government and the Syrian parties to cease violence in accordance (with) the plan,” he told reporters. “I believe there should be no preconditions for stopping violence.”
Annan insisted the deal was not in tatters, however.
“The plan has not been implemented according to the schedule that we laid out... but it does not mean that it cannot be implemented.”
In a letter to the Security Council, he said “the days before April 10 could have been an opportunity for the government of Syria to send a powerful political signal of peace. In the last five days it has become clear that such a signal has yet to be issued.”
