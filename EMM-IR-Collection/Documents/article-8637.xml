  <text>Fierce attacks on Syrian opposition neighbourhoods marked the run up to a dawn deadline set for all sides to observe a ceasefire.
In Washington where G8 foreign ministers are meeting, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced their scepticism  over whether a truce would hold after Syria said it reserved the right to respond to attacks.
But few in the Syrian opposition believe Assad has any intention of complying long-term with Annan and his mission  to end 13 months of bloodshed. If no progress is made, the Syrian National Council has called for Assad to be given an international ultimatum.
