The head of a UN mission warned on Saturday of "civil war" in Syria after his 
  observers counted more than 92 bodies, 32 of them children, in the central 
  town of Houla following reports of a massacre there.

  amid mounting calls for world action to halt the bloodshed
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Friday's 
  shelling in the city of Houla, in central Homs province, had led to what 
  seemed to be one of the bloodiest episodes so far of the 15-month long 
Unconfirmed amateur videos posted by activists on YouTube showed around 20 
  bodies, mostly young children, lying in a room. One man holds up the limp 
  body of a boy aged around seven, a gaping hole punched in the lower portion 
  of his face. "This child, what did he do to deserve this?", he

Other footage shows the corpses of men and women lying under patterned 
  blankets, including what is said to be one entire family. "We're being 
  slaughtered like sheep here," says one voice. "Where are the UN 
  observers?" adds another.
William Hague, Foreign Secretary, has condemned the latest violence, saying 
  the UK will press for an urgent session of the United Nations Security 
  Council to co-ordinate the response to the "appalling" crime.
"There are credible and horrific reports that a large number of civilians 
  have been massacred at the hands of Syrian forces in the town of Houla, 
  including children," he said.
"Our urgent priority is to establish a full account of this appalling 
  crime and to move swiftly to ensure that those responsible are identified 
  and held to account.
"We are consulting urgently with our allies on a strong international 
  response, including at the UN Security Council, the EU and UN human rights 
Mr Hague urged President Bashar Assad's regime to grant "full and 
  immediate" access to Houla for UN monitors and stop all military 
  options, as demanded by special envoy Kofi Annan.
The Free Syrian Army said on Saturday it could no longer commit to the 
  ceasefire brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan unless there was an 
  immediate solution to regime violence.
"We announce that unless the UN Security Council takes urgent steps for 
  the protection of civilians, Annan's plan is going to go to hell," a 
  statement by the FSA said.
The fresh claims of regime atrocities led the opposition Syrian National 
  Council to call on the UN Security Council to take urgent action. At the 
  same time, the Observatory accused the Arab and international communities of 
  being "complicit" in the killing, saying that shelling that had 
  begun on Friday had continued into the night. The Observatory said the 
  international community was standing "silent in the face of the 
  massacres committed by the Syrian regime."
