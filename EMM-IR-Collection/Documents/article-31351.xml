''A flagrant violation of international law'' ... United Nations observers in a hospital morgue view children alleged to have been killed in shelling from Syrian government forces. Photo: AFP
BEIRUT:  The blood-spattered children lay on a patterned rug, their wounds graphic proof that youth offers no protection from the dark forces unleashed in Syria.
An unidentified man picks up the limp corpse of one boy, displaying the battered remains for the camera. He puts the child down and hoists another lifeless young body aloft.  ''Massacre in Houla - all children!'' someone is heard shouting amid groans of agony and disbelief.
The grisly scenes posted online  from Houla, a township in Homs province, drew international condemnation. In the view of some they have the potential to become a turning point in the 14-month rebellion against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
The United Nations said  92 people, more than one-third of them children aged under 10, had been killed in what appeared to be the worst violence against civilians in Syria since a UN-backed cease-fire was put into effect last month.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the UN-Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, condemned the massacre  as a ''brutal'' breach of international law by the government.
''This appalling and brutal crime, involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force, is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centres and violence in all its forms,'' they said.
''Those responsible for perpetrating this crime must be held to account.''
Britain said it was in urgent talks with allied countries on ''a strong international response''. France said it was making plans to host a Friends of Syria meeting.
In Washington, the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, focused on what she described as the ''vicious assault that involved a regime artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighbourhood''.
''Those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account,'' she said. ''And the United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.''
The Foreign Affairs Minister, Bob Carr, said Australia's UN ambassador had been ordered to begin canvassing increased sanctions against the Syrian regime. He would also discuss with member states the possibility of referring the massacre to the International Criminal Court.
''The Assad regime must cease all military operations immediately, as required under special envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan,'' Senator Carr said in a statement.
''UN observers must also be allowed immediate access to Houla to start work on determining responsibility for this attack, as well as to all other conflict zones in Syria.
''This matter should also be immediately brought before the UN Security Council, for a unified international response.''
The killings occurred during a government offensive on Friday and early Saturday, opposition activists said.
The official government news agency blamed ''armed terrorists'' linked to al-Qaeda for the killings in an area that has long been at the epicentre of the revolt against Mr  Assad.
Outrage over the deaths of so many children may drive demands for new international action. The opposition called for an emergency UN meeting, even as Mr Annan was scheduled to visit Damascus this week.
Juan Cole, a University of Michigan historian and  commentator on Middle Eastern affairs, suggested in a blog post that Houla could become a decisive event in Syria comparable to the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. ''Just as the US public began turning against the Vietnam War because of events like the My Lai massacre, so Houla could be a turning point,'' he  wrote.
However, Mr  Assad is widely thought to maintain considerable support in Syria, especially among Christians and other minorities, notably members of his own Alawite sect who hold important posts in the security services and the military.
He also enjoys the backing of Russia and China, permanent members of the UN Security Council. Both support the peace initiative headed by Mr Annan, but have vetoed Security Council resolutions critical of Mr Assad.
The state-controlled Syrian media also broadcast graphic images of the children's corpses, but blamed the killings on ''al-Qaeda-linked terrorist groups''. The official Syrian Arab News Agency said ''terrorist'' groups had burned houses and crops in a bid to put the blame on the army.  Each side regularly accuses the other of committing massacres.
