  <text>Protesters took to the streets on Friday for the biggest demonstration in the Syrian city of Aleppo since the uprising against Bashar al-Assad's regime began in March 2011, monitors said.
"These are the most important events in Aleppo since the beginning of the revolt. Thousands of people demonstrated in various districts despite the repression," Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP.
"Aleppo is experiencing a real uprising," a local activist Mohammad Halabi told AFP in Beirut.
Anti-regime activists had earlier called for Friday protests under the slogan, "heroes of Aleppo University," in solidarity with students who demonstrated despite brutal repression against the university.
Students in the northern city demonstrated on campus demanding the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime on Thursday as UN observers visited to oversee a ceasefire, largely ignored for a month, according to activists.
