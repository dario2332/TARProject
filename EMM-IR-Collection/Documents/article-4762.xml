  <text>The organizers of the 1980 military coup in Turkey have appeared before a court of law in Ankara.
Former Turkish President Kenan Evren, who led the coup in his capacity of the Chief of the General Staff in 1980, and the former Air Force Chief, Tahseen Shahinkai, are in the dock.
They are the only organizers of the coup of more than 30 years ago who are alive. They were immune from prosecution until September 2010.
Now Evren and Shahinkai are facing life in prison for the overthrow of a lawful government, the disbandment of parliament, as well as for the murder and torture that were practiced during the military rule of 1980 through 1983.
