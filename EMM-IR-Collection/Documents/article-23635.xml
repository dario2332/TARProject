  <text>Three killed in northern Italy earthquake
GetArticleDate("5/20/2012 7:16:21 AM");
An earthquake in northern Italy has killed at least three people and caused thousands of others to flee into the streets, officials say.
The 6.0-magnitude quake struck in the middle of the night, about 35km (22 miles) north of the city of Bologna.
The officials say the three victims died when the buildings they were working in collapsed.
Italian TV showed damaged factories and church steeples in the region. Aftershocks have been reported.
Rescue teams are now combing the area amid reports that a number of people may be buried under rubble.
The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10km just after 0400 local time (0200 GMT).
It was felt across a huge sway of northern Italy, including the cities of Bologna, Ferrara, Verona and Mantua.
