  <text>On Thursday, Breivik described his original plan was for a "very large operation" that included three car bombs and at least one shooting. He told the courtroom, where the families of victims and survivors of the attack were in attendance, that if he survived the bombings he was going to drive a motorcycle to multiple targets, executing as many people at each before moving on.
Breivik detailed much of his training -- and much of his plot -- in the rambling 1,500-page manifesto, "2083: A Declaration of European Independence." In it, he not only espoused the militant right-wing philosophy the court heard echoes of on Tuesday, but also explained how he made the bomb that eventually killed eight people and where he bought the materials. Last year, police were able to use this information to track down and arrest 19 Polish nationals who were selling bomb-making materials online.
The manifesto suggests that Breivik had been plotting the attacks -- or at least some variation thereof -- for the past nine years and he told the court on Thursday that he had starting considering the idea of political violence when he was "19-20 years old," some 13 years before the July 22 massacre.
Some of his training, as he revealed during questioning, included playing thousands of hours of video games like "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" and "World of Warcraft," the former giving him practice in targeting and fighting his way out of government buildings.
Before settling a "shooting operation" on Utoya, Breivik also considered attacks on the Aftenposten newspaper, City Hall and the Royal Castle.
During proceedings on Wednesday, Breivik himself said that a 21-year maximum sentence was unacceptable and "pathetic."
"There are only two just and fair outcomes of this case. One is an acquittal, the other is capital punishment," he said.
