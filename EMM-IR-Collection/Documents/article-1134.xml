  <text>ANKARA, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Two people were wounded when a bus carrying a group of Turks came under attack in the restive Homs province in Syria, Turkish media reported Monday.
The attack occurred near the city of Homs, the provincial capital of Homs province, a flashpoint in Syria's months-long unrest, the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News reported, quoting officials of the Turkish foreign ministry.
Turkish NTV said two people on the bus were injured, without providing further details.
The Turkish IHA news agency said the driver of the bus was injured in the attack but it managed to reach the Turkish border.
The Turkish daily Vatan newspaper's website reported the bus was carrying Turkish pilgrims.
Syrian pro-government demonstrators attacked the Turkish diplomatic missions in the Syrian capital of Damascus and two other cities on Nov. 13 after the Arab League voted to suspend Syria's participation in its meetings and impose sanctions on the government for its alleged crackdown on protesters.
Turkey evacuated the families of its diplomats after the attacks and sent a diplomatic note to Syria on Sunday over the matter. The foreign ministry has also advised Turkish citizens to avoid travelling to the unrest-hit country.
Turkey last week suspended joint oil exploration plans in six wells in Syria.
