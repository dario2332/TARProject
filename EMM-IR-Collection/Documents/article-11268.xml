The Afghan president praised his own forces after they killed the final 
  resisting members of insurgent suicide teams, but ordered an investigation 
  into how the militants had been able to penetrate the city.
He spoke as Afghan intelligence officials said the string of coordinated 
  assaults across eastern Afghanistan was carried out by the Taliban-linked 
Mr Karzai said: "The terrorists' infiltration in Kabul and other 
  provinces is an intelligence failure for us and especially for Nato and 
  should be seriously investigated."
His comments prompted Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Nato secretary general, to warn 
  against descending into a blame game after the attack.
"I think we are in this together. We should help each other," he

Insurgents who launched attacks killed in overnight operation
Seventeen hours of fighting ended soon after dawn yesterday when Afghan 
  soldiers stormed a half-built tower block overlooking Kabul's diplomatic 
  quarter and killed six fighters.
Those in the tower were the last holdouts of a multifaceted attack which saw 
  fighting in up to seven sites in Kabul and in three cities in eastern 
Witnesses described Afghan commandos clearing the tower floor-by-floor 
  overnight to dislodge the militants who had seized it as a base to launch 
  rocket and machine gun attacks into nearby diplomatic missions, including 
  the British embassy.
Despite Nato claims that Afghan forces had dealt with the attacks on their 
  own, witnesses said British and Norwegian special forces troops had been 
  with the commandos and had fired heavy weapons into the tower. The Ministry 
  of Defence in London declined to comment.
"It was an international organised operation, but it was Afghan-led," 
  said a former British Army officer who watched from a nearby compound.
"The Afghans provided the muscle, the internationals provided the 
Anti-tank rockets and strafing runs from Blackhawk helicopters were used on 
  the militants, before the Afghan commandos moved up through the building in 
  the early hours of Monday, he said.
The assault teams used ladders on scaffolding around the building to avoid the 
  building's two staircases, and threw grenades into each level before one man 
  rushed up with a pistol, followed by his comrades.
Afghan officials left the dead attackers, covered in brick dust and blood, 
  sprawled on the concrete staircases where they had been shot, as they showed 
  journalists around the tower hours later.
The attackers all appeared in their late teens or early twenties and wore 
Seddiq Seddiqui, spokesman for the ministry of interior, said: "It's too 
  early to comment on intelligence failures. Our answer is that the Taliban 
  were beaten hard, we controlled the damage and if they even dream of doing 
  this again, they will face the same consequences."
A total of 36 insurgent fighters died across Afghanistan, he said. One 
  attacker captured in Nangarhar province was said to have confessed the 
  operations were carried out by the Haqqani Network, an autonomous Taliban 
  faction alleged to have close ties to sections of Pakistan's military.
Eight members of the Afghan security forces and three civilians also died, 
  with about 40 members of the security forces and 25 civilians were injured.
Nato played down the significance of the attacks.
"They were not able to penetrate the most sensitive areas, the diplomatic 
  zone," a senior alliance official said.
"They were able to penetrate until outside and to lob a few grenades into
