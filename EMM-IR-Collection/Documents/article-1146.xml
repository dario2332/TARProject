Police and military forces sporadically used batons, tear gas  and birdshot to try to clear the central square of thousands of  protesters demanding for a third straight day that the ruling  military cede power to a civilian authority.
But by mid-morning today large crowds were again streaming  to Tahrir, the symbolic heart of demonstrations that toppled  Mubarak in February, correspondents said.
The health ministry said 22 people had died in the violence,  kicking off a violent countdown to the country's November 28  parliamentary elections, the first since the end of former  president Mubarak's 30-year-rule.
"The deaths in (Cairo's) Tahrir Square and several provinces has  reached 22," since clashes broke out on Saturday, the health  ministry said in a statement today carried by the official MENA  news agency.
Hundreds have also been injured during the protests that broke  out in Cairo, Alexandria and the canal city of Suez.
"War in the Square," read the headline of the state-owned  Al-Akhbar, while the liberal Wafd daily said "Egypt is sitting on a  volcano."
The clashes first erupted on Saturday, a day after large crowds  staged a peaceful anti-military mass rally at the square, resuming yesterday and carrying through the night into this morning,  witnesses and television footage showed.
Police and troops yesterday seized the square only to be beaten  back by protesters who retook it later, as had also happened on  Saturday.
An AFP reporter said late yesterday that on one street  protesters were throwing stones and petrol bombs at military  armoured personnel carriers and riot police.
He said military police had responded with mostly shotgun fire  and rubber bullets. When there was steady fire some protesters  began to run while others chanted "Hold fast! Hold fast!" and "We  won't leave!"
There were heavy clashes on side streets leading to the interior  ministry as protesters chanted: "The people want to topple the  field marshal" - Hussein Tantawi, Mubarak's long-time defence  minister who heads the ruling military.
In the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, a funeral procession on  Sunday for one of the victims degenerated into clashes with the  police who fired volleys of tear gas at mourners, state news agency  MENA reported.
In the canal city of Suez, troops fired live rounds into the air  to stop protesters from storming a police station in the city  centre, also yesterday.
Protests also broke out in the central cities of Qena and  Assiut, a security official said, adding that 55 people had been  arrested nationwide.
Egypt's cabinet, which held crisis talks yesterday for several  hours before moving en masse to the headquarters of the ruling  Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) for another meeting,  said in a statement that next week's parliamentary elections would  go ahead.
The SCAF, in a statement read out on state television, said it  "regretted" what was happening. It said it was committed to the  elections timetable.
Earlier, Mohsen al-Fangari, a member of the council, insisted  the election would go ahead as planned and that the authorities  were able to guarantee security.
"We will not give in to calls to delay the elections. The armed  forces and the interior ministry are able to secure the polling  stations," Fangari told a talk show on the Egyptian satellite  channel Al-Hayat.
Several prominent political figures and intellectuals, including  former UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei, earlier issued  a call for a delay to the legislative polls.
They submitted a new transition roadmap which would see an  elected constituent assembly draft a constitution and then a  presidential election would be held, followed by parliamentary  polls.
Friday's rally, which grouped Islamist and secular activists,  called on the military to hand power to a civilian government. It  also demanded more control over the constitution the new parliament  is to draft.
Protesters called for the withdrawal of a government document  that proposes supra-constitutional principles, which could see the  military maintain some control over the country's affairs and keep  its budget from public scrutiny.
The military says it will hand over power after a presidential  election, which has yet to be scheduled.
