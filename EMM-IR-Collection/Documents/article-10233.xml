  <text>JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa voiced support for a UN Observer Mission to Syria on Saturday, hours before the UN Security Council cast a vote on the mission.
Deputy foreign minister Ebrahim Ebrahim said in a statement that all sides in the conflict should "fully implement their commitments" made to the UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
"The Deputy Minister reiterated South Africa's support for the call made by (Annan) regarding the urgent deployment of a UN Observer Mission to verify and monitor the cease-fire," said the statement.
The UN Security Council on Saturday decided to send an advance team of up to 30 unarmed military observers to Syria to monitor a ceasefire between the Syrian government forces and armed opposition fighters.
The Security Council adopted a resolution authorizing the observers to "liaise with the parties and to begin to report on the implementation of a full cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties."
South Africa abstained from voting for a resolution last October, saying the resolution had a "hidden agenda" to bring down Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The resolution was not passed by the Security Council.
