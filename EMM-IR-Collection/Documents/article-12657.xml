  <text>KIRKUK, Iraq, April 19 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were killed and 29 wounded in separate bomb attacks in and near the city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq on Thursday, a local police source told Xinhua.
In Kirkuk, some 250 km north of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, two car bombs and a roadside bomb hit a police station in the morning, killing a total of four policemen and wounding 23 people, including seven policemen, the source said on condition of anonymity.
Colonel Taha Mohammed, police chief of the al-Maqdad police station, was among the wounded, the source said.
Near Kirkuk, six mortar rounds landed on a village in the city of Dibis, some 45 km northwest of Kirkuk, killing four people and wounding six others, the source added.
The ethnically mix province of Kirkuk and its capital Kirkuk City are part of disputed areas between the Kurds and both Arabs and Turkomans. The area has long been the hotbed of insurgency since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.
Earlier, the police reported that a series of bomb attacks struck Baghdad, Salahudin and Diyala provinces on Thursday morning, killing a total of 31 people and wounding 110 others.
