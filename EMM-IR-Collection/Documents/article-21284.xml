  <text>Thank you all for submitting such thoughtful questions and insights into the article about how the Sanford Police Department handled the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, 17, on the night of Feb. 26.
The case is currently being prosecuted by State Attorney Angela B. Corey. She has charged the man who fired the shot, George Zimmerman, 28, with second-degree murder, and Mr. Zimmerman, claiming self-defense, has entered a written plea of not guilty. Discovery in the case has not yet been made public and the prosecution is not discussing the case, so my answers are limited by the fact that we are still waiting for more of the evidence in the case to be released.
George Zimmerman’s father, Robert, has told me that his son told the police that he shot Mr. Martin at close range during a struggle in which Mr. Martin was on top of him, hitting him and pounding his head onto concrete. Mr. Martin was shot once in the chest.
Some Sanford officers were skeptical about certain details of Mr. Zimmerman’s account. For instance, he told the police that Mr. Martin had punched him numerous times, but they questioned whether his injuries were consistent with the number of blows he claimed to have received. They also suspected that some of the threatening and dramatic language that Mr. Zimmerman said Mr. Martin used during the struggle — like “You are going to die tonight” — sounded made up.
It was a probable cause affidavit filed in the case. It is an affidavit of two investigators in the office of State Attorney Corey, the special prosecutor appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott to handle the case. The two investigators are T.C. O’Steen and Dale Gilbreath.
According to a lawyer for the Martin family, Benjamin Crump, Trayvon Martin’s father learned of the call while reviewing his son’s cellphone bills a few weeks after the shooting. Mr. Crump subsequently conducted an interview with the girl and recorded it.
That is an excellent question. Mr. Wolfinger, the original prosecutor in the case,  has declined to be interviewed to explain what this conflict of interest may be and to answer other questions. And Governor Scott has also turned down requests for an interview to discuss what he knows about the conflict of interest, and how and why he chose Ms. Corey to take over the case.
