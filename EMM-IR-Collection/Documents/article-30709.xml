  <text>The Free Syrian Army has said it can no longer commit to the ceasefire brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan unless there is an immediate solution to regime violence.
"We announce that unless the UN Security Council takes urgent steps for the protection of civilians, Annan's plan is going to go to hell," a statement by the FSA said on Saturday.
The statement came as General Robert Mood, Syria's UN mission chief , condemned Friday's killings as a "brutal tragedy", saying that monitors had counted more than 92 corpses in Houla, a town in Homs province.
"This morning UN military and civilian observers went to Houla and counted more than 32 children and over 60 adults killed," he said in a statement on Saturday.
"Those using violence for their own agendas will create more instability, more unpredictability and may lead country to civil war," Mood added in remarks to reporters in Damascus
Residents of Houla had buried victims of the masscare in mass graves as monitors visited the area on Saturday.
The peace plan drawn up by Kofi Annan, which began on April 12, stipulates that UN observers be deployed in the country to monitor a ceasefire. But the violence and bloodshed have not stopped.
The killings in Houla took place after Syrian government forces tried to break into the town on Friday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Amateur video posted online showed scores of dead bodies, including children, covered by blankets following the violence.
Activists from the region said government forces hammered Houla with mortars following a large anti-regime protest on Friday.
After the bombardment, pro-government thugs, known as shabiha, raided the villages, killing men on the streets and stabbing women and children in their houses.
Houla has been the scene of frequent anti-government protests since the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began in March last year. The town has also become a hub for opposition fighters.
Syria's main opposition bloc put the toll at more than 100 and urged the UN Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to examine the massacre.
"Some of the victims were hit by heavy artillery while others, entire families, were massacred," said a statement by Bassma Kodmani, the Syrian National Council's head of foreign relations.
Activists told Al Jazeera that the town came under shelling again on Saturday.
Hadi al-Abdallah, speaking from Homs, said Houla is under the control of the FSA, which means government troops cannot enter the town. Instead, they are launching shells from a distance in a bid to defeat the rebels.
International action
Syrians turned out in several locations around the country on Saturday to protest against the killings.
In Kafr Nabel, in the northern province of Idlib, scores took to the streets to honour the dead, chanting: "We sacrifice our soul and life for you, oh people of Houla," according to a video posted on YouTube.
In a Damascus neighbourhood, women filmed hiding their faces were carrying papers that read: "The Syrian regime kills us under supervision of the UN observers" and "Banish the UN tourists".
Laurent Fabius, French foreign minister, condemned the assault and called for greater international action.
"In the face of horror, the international community must mobilise still further to stop the martyrdom of the Syrian people," he said in a statement
British Foreign Secretary William Hague, in a statement, noted the "credible and horrific reports" of the violence in Houla, adding that there was a need "to move swiftly to ensure that those responsible are identified and held to account".
The latest violence came as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, blamed the government for much of the "unacceptable levels of violence and abuses" occurring every day in the 14-month-long crisis in Syria.
In a report to the UN Security Council on Friday, Ban cited the government's continued use of heavy weapons, reports of shelling and "a stepped-up security crackdown by the authorities that has led to massive violations of human rights by government forces and pro-government militias".
Ban said there had only been "small progress" on implementing the six-point joint UN-Arab League plan brokered by Annan.
