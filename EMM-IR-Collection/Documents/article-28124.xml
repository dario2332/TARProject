Amnesty International says the United Nations security council is failing in its global peacekeeping role and looks to be redundant.In its annual report, the rights groups say the security council is increasingly "unfit for purpose", and is failing to match the courage of protesters around the world.The rights group called for the signing of a strong treaty on the global arms trade when the United Nations meets in July, saying it would be a test for world leaders to place rights over profits. Amnesty highlighted the failure to end the bloodshed in Syria and said repeated vetoes by major arms exporters Russia and China had left the UN's top security body "looking redundant as a guardian of global peace". The report also singled out emerging powers India, Brazil and South Africa, saying they were "complicit through their silence" on key rights issues. In its 50th annual report, Amnesty said the vocal support by many global powers in the early months of the Arab Spring in 2011 had not translated into action, with many international leaders now looking the other way.Australia criticisedAmnesty International's latest assessment of the state of the world's human rights is critical of Australian Government policy on indigenous affairs and refugees.It says Australia continues to violate the rights of indigenous people, and is driving them from their homelands.Amnesty International is particularly critical of new legislation aimed at extending the Northern Territory intervention, that's soon to be debated in the senate. Many indigenous people say it will take away self determination for another ten years. Amnesty's national director, Claire Mallinson, says the so-called Stronger Futures legislation echoes the policies of the assimilation era. "If passed, we will see another ten years of policies that stigmatise people, that don't meet people's needs, and are not proven to be effective. The government says the bill will help keep children in schools, and lessen violence and substance abuse. Burma accusedIn its annual report, Amnesty International also accused Burma's military of committing crimes against humanity in ethnic conflict zones, where ongoing fighting has overshadowed sweeping political changes. The rights group also alleges authorities have blocked humanitarian aid from reaching tens of thousands of desperate refugees in conflict areas.It also accuses soldiers of sexually assaulting civilians. Amnesty says the government has enacted limited political and economic reforms, but human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law in ethnic minority areas increased during the year.It says some of those amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes.Bin Laden raidThe United States has been criticised in the report for using lethal force in the killing of Osama bin Laden in a commando raid. "The US administration made clear that the operation had been conducted under the USA's theory of a global armed conflict between the USA and Al-Qaeda in which the USA does not recognize the applicability of international human rights law," Amnesty said. "In the absence of further clarification from the US authorities, the killing of Osama bin Laden would appear to have been unlawful." Amnesty said a request for clarification over an apparent US drone strike in Yemen last September that killed US-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaqi, his Al-Qaeda co-conspirator Samir Khan and at least two others had also gone unanswered. It has also criticised Canada for failing to arrest former US president George W. Bush during a visit in October, "despite clear evidence that he was responsible for crimes under international law, including torture."
