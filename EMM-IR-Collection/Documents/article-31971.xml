  <text>The U.N. Security Council on Sunday condemned the killing of at least 108 people, many of them children, in the town of Houla, amid mounting world outrage at the massacre, which the Syrian government and rebels blamed on each other.
The images of the bloodied bodies of children triggered shock around the world and underlined the failure of a six-week-old ceasefire plan to stop the violence in the 14-month uprising against Assad’s rule.
The United Nations says more than 10,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict since it started 15 months ago. Syrian activists put the toll at more than 13,000.
