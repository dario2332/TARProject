  <text>DAMASCUS - Syria and the United Nations signed an agreement on Thursday on the terms of a ceasefire monitoring mission, a Reuters witness at the Foreign Ministry in Damascus said.
A statement from the UN-Arab League mediator Kofi Annan said the Syrian government and the United Nations had agreed a basis for a "protocol" on the deployment of more observers.
Earlier, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said an observer mission would require between 300 and 400 people to oversee the country properly, more than the 250 observers the Syrian government says is reasonable.
Speaking shortly before a meeting in Paris of foreign ministers from the international "Friends of Syria" coalition, Juppe, said the group would discuss contingency plans for a potential unraveling of a UN-backed peace plan.
"If it is not possible (to implement the plan) then we will look at what new measures need to be taken," Juppe told a media briefing ahead of the talks with delegations from 14 countries including the United States, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is holding a "Friends of Syria" group meeting Thursday evening in Paris with European and Arab ministers from countries that had at previous meetings discussed support for opponents of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government.
Russia called the meeting "destructive," saying it could undermine Annan's peace efforts. Though it was invited to join, Russia stayed away because the talks were "one-sided" without representation from the Syrian government, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said.
The goal of the meeting appeared to be not to seek dialogue among Syrians but "on the contrary, to deepen differences between the opposition and Damascus by stimulating the international isolation of the latter," he said.
