  <text>BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhuanet) -- Syrian authorities have denied that government troops were behind an attack in Houla. This comes as protests broke out in the city to condemn a massacre that left more than 108 people dead, many of them children.
Friday’s assault on civilians in the central village of Houla was one of the single bloodiest events in Syria’s 15-month unrest. The UN says 32 children under the age of 10 were among the dead. However, Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihan Makdissi denied Sunday that government troops were involved.
Syria foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said, "We firmly deny the responsibility of government forces in this massacre that has occurred. We strongly condemn this terrorist massacre that targeted in a clearly criminal way Syria’s people: women, children and old men."
Amateur videos posted online showed people in Houla burying dozens of their relatives in mass graves. Syria said the massacre was carried out by "terrorists" after fighting between rebels and Syrian military forces. While the opposition claimed that government troops and pro-government militia carried out the slaughtering.
Makdissi said, "There has been a quantitative improvement in the weaponry used in the conflict in Syria. The weapons being used by the rebels are not small arms; there are mortars and the newest thing is the use of anti-tank missiles. This is new to the confrontation facing Syrian government forces."
Makdesi announced that a committee will be formed to investigate the incident, with results released within three days. He also said the government briefed Kofi Annan on Houla’s massacre, and that the international envoy will be in Damascus Monday.
