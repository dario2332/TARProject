  <text>The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting Sunday afternoon to discuss the recent massacre in the Syrian town of Houla, in which more than 90 people died, many of them children under the age of 10.
The council meeting was called after Russia rejected a French and British proposal for a statement condemning the massacre.
The massacre, which included at least 32 children, has sparked international outrage and raised fears that the international peace plan is in tatters. Syrian authorities, meanwhile, continue to deny involvement in the killings and they're reportedly preventing a top aide to international envoy Kofi Annan from heading to Damascus this week.
Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi on Sunday blamed "armed terrorist groups" for the attack in Houla. He said a committee has been set up to investigate the incident, and results should be out within three days. He added that Annan will fly to Syria on Monday.
A senior Arab League official said Syria has denied permission for Annan's deputy to travel to Damascus. Syria made clear the decision against former Palestinian Foreign Minister Nasser al-Kidwa is not personal, but rather because it did not want to deal with the Arab League, the official said on condition of anonymity. Annan is the joint envoy of the UN and Arab League.
More than a dozen amateur videos posted online on Saturday gave glimpses of the carnage in the Houla area of central Syria. One video is said to show UN monitors being shown the shrouded corpses of those killed, laid out in rows inside what appeared to be a mosque.
"We firmly deny the responsibility of government forces in this massacre that has occurred. We strongly condemn this terrorist massacre that targeted in a clearly criminal way Syria's people: women, children and old men," Makdissi said.
The assault on Houla, northwest of the central city of Homs, was one of the bloodiest single events in Syria's 14-month-old uprising.
British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, in an interview broadcast Sunday,said the "scenes of savagery" are "just revolting, stomach-churning."
Clegg told the BBC's Andrew Marr those responsible for human rights crimes will be barred from entering Britain.
The chief of the UN monitoring mission, Maj.-Gen. Robert Mood, on Saturday condemned the violence. He confirmed the use of artillery tank shells, without elaborating.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council this week.
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird called the latest bloodshed “very disconcerting because of its depravity.” He said the international community needs to redouble its efforts to get Syria to agree to an international peace plan mapped out a month ago, or explore other diplomatic solutions.
Activists said Syria's regime forces peppered residential areas of Houla with mortars after large demonstrations on Friday.
That evening, they said, pro-regime fighters known as shabiha stormed villages, gunning down men in the streets and stabbing women and children in their homes.
UN observers, among more than 250 who were dispatched in recent weeks to salvage the ceasefire plan, found spent artillery tank shells at the site Saturday.
UN officials confirmed the shells were fired at residential neighbourhoods.
The Syrian government blamed the attack on "armed terrorist groups" but provided no details or death toll.
The Houla villages are Sunni Muslim.
The forces came from an arc of nearby villages populated by Alawites, members of the offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad belongs, the activists said.
The activists said the killings appeared to be sectarian between the two groups, raising fears that Syria's uprising, which started in March 2011, is edging closer to the type of war that tore apart the country's eastern neighbour, Iraq.
The bloodshed is yet another blow to the international peace plan brokered by envoy Kofi Annan and cast a pall over his coming visit to check on its progress.
The ceasefire between forces loyal to the regime of President Bashar Assad and rebels seeking to topple it was supposed to start on 12 April but has never really taken hold, with new killings every day.
The UN put the death toll weeks ago at more than 9,000.
Hundreds have been killed since then.
