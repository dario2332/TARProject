  <text>A suspected suicide blast has rocked a shrine packed with worshippers marking a Shia holy day in the Afghan capital, Kabul.
A health ministry spokesman said 14 people had been killed, but other reports have put the toll much higher.
Another blast hit the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif at about the same time, killing four people.
The attacks appear to be of a sectarian nature unprecedented in recent Afghan history, correspondents say.
It coincided with the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura - the most important day in the Shia calendar and marked with a public holiday in Afghanistan.
The near-simultaneous explosions happened at about midday (0730 GMT).
The police have cordoned off all roads to the blast site in the medieval Murad Khani district where many Shias had gathered to commemorate Ashura at the Abu Fazal mosque.
Here, at an emergency surgical centre just 10 minutes from the site, people are gathered crying and wailing. I have heard women shouting: "My son is dead, my son is dead." I have seen people with charred clothing.
Security forces have been ferrying victims to waiting ambulances. There are many wounded too. Those who were there say there are a lot of casualties.  People are gathering in front of the hospital and the police are on the streets around here controlling the traffic.
In Kabul, the bomb went off near a group of singing Shias gathered at the Abu Fazal shrine, AFP news agency reported.
"I was there watching people mourning [for Ashura] when there was suddenly a huge explosion," witness Ahmad Fawad told AFP.
Amid the chaos straight after the blast, a young girl, dressed in a green shalwar kameez (traditional dress) smeared in blood, stood shrieking, surrounded by the crumpled, piled-up bodies of children, AFP reported.
The blasts also caused scores of injuries, with sources at the Afghan health ministry saying 67 casualties have arrived at hospitals.
Police said they foiled another attack elsewhere in the capital.
The bomb which exploded near the main mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif was apparently strapped to a bicycle, and went off shortly after the Kabul blast.
Balkh province Deputy Police Chief Abdul Raouf Taj said the device exploded as a convoy of Shias, shouting in celebration of Ashura, passed by, the Associated Press news agency reported.
There are tensions between Afghan Sunni and minority Shia Muslims in Afghanistan, but violence of the type seen in Pakistan or Iraq is rare, our correspondent says.
Over the past decade Shias in Afghanistan have celebrated their festivals more confidently, openly and on a bigger scale than ever before.
Most attacks in Afghanistan target government officials or international forces, and are claimed by militant groups such as the Taliban or Haqqani network.
Pakistan boycotted the conference, after a Nato attack killed 24 of its troops at a checkpoint near the Afghan border last month.
Afghan security officials held their breath during the conference, our correspondent says, fearing there might an attack in Kabul to divert attention.
