  <text>CAIRO &amp;mdash; Egypt's military rulers struggled Monday to contain an explosion of protests demanding their ouster, as demonstrators clashed for a third successive day with security forces around Tahrir Square and new clashes broke out across the country.

Egyptian troops, heralded as saviors when their generals ushered out President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11, led a new push to clear the square on Sunday. And the fighting took a more lethal toll: the Health Ministry said that at least 22 people were killed.
Battles raged throughout the night, with gunfire echoing through streets choked with tear gas and illuminated by scattered fires. Three bodies wrapped in blankets were seen being carried away and witnesses said the bodies were those of protesters hit by live ammunition.
On Monday morning, the thoroughfares of downtown Cairo were littered with stones and other debris from the fighting. An apartment building near Tahrir Square was damaged by a fire sparked when a tear gas canister landed on a third-floor balcony, protesters said.
Security forces continued to rain tear gas on demonstrators who clogged a street of upscale apartments leading from Tahrir Square to the Interior Ministry. By midday, thousands of protesters remained in control of the square and its side streets.
A general from the ruling military council visited Tahrir Square on Monday and spoke in a brief news conference, where he said the council respected the protesters' right to peaceful protest. He declared that the security forces had not initiated any violence but only defended themselves, and he insisted &amp;mdash; despite a sweep of the square Sunday evening by hundreds of soldiers and police in riot gear &amp;mdash; that the security forces had not entered the square.
Asked about the reports of protesters injured by gunfire from security forces, he said the victims were "thugs," not peaceful demonstrators. He urged the crowd to consider the economic cost of shutting the central square to traffic and disrupting city life, reminding them of losses this week in the Egyptian stock market.
"There is an invisible hand in the square causing a rift between the army and the people," the general said. His name was not immediately released.
The violence has seemed to reinforce the revolutionary urgency that had returned to the square, and when the army moved to push out the thousands of protesters on Sunday, more than twice as many quickly flooded back.
"This is February 12!" said Abeer Mustafa, a 42-year-old wedding planner. "We have finally succeeded in reclaiming our revolution."
The crackdown, including the reported use of live ammunition by troops, elicited condemnation across the political spectrum, joined by voices who had previously taken a more restrained tone toward the military council, from the liberal former diplomat Mohamed ElBaradei to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.
Almost all the civilian parties called for an accelerated end to military rule before the drafting of a constitution &amp;mdash; either an immediate handover to some civilian unity government, a turnover to the lower house of Parliament when it is seated in April, or after a presidential election, to be scheduled as soon as possible.
But while unity reappeared in the square, where Coptic Christians once again stood guard as their Muslim compatriots bowed to pray, the political class remained deeply polarized over what sort of civilian government might succeed the military. Liberals and Islamists continued to battle each other in back-room arguments over the question of what rules the military might set for the selection of a constitutional convention, even as the street protesters demanded that the military give up such authority.
In its first official response to the crisis, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces repeated its commitment to its "road map" of the transition, including next week's elections, but it did nothing to move up or clarify its exit date, now set for some time after drafting of a constitution and electing of a president in perhaps 2013 or beyond. The council expressed "sorrow" over the situation. It said it had ordered an investigation and it asked the political parties to "contain the situation."

The turkey "pardon" is a distasteful reminder of the power we give politicians over death-row prisoners.
The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank should engage in further monetary stimulus.
