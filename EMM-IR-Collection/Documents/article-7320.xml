  <text>UNITED NATIONS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Kofi Annan, the UN and Arab League joint special envoy for Syria, on Tuesday urged the Syrian authorities to "seize the opportunity to make a fundamental change of course" by immediately implementing a peace plan proposed by Annan and accepted by Damascus.
Annan made the statement in his letter to the UN Security Council Tuesday, the deadline for the Syrian military to withdraw from urban areas. A copy of the letter was obtained by Xinhua here.
The Syrian government must send a political signal by achieving a cessation of its military operations in the coming days, Annan said. He also called for a quick action by the UN Security Council to deploy "an effective international monitoring mechanisms" in Syria, which has been plunged into crisis since March 2011.
"The Syrian leadership should now seize the opportunity to make a fundamental change of course," Annan said in the letter, adding "It is essential that the next 48 hours bring visible signs of immediate and indisputable change in the military posture of the government forces throughout the country."
Annan was appointed to mediate an early end to the year-long crisis in Syria on behalf of the United Nations and the Arab League.
Annan's six-point plan calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons and troops from population centers, a daily halt in fighting for the delivery of humanitarian aid and treatment for the wounded, as well as talks between the government and opposition.
If the Syrian government meets the April 10 deadline, the Syrian opposition should halt fighting 48 hours after the withdrawal of government forces, so all fighting in the country must stop by 6 a.m. Damascus time on April 12, Annan said last week while briefing the UN General Assembly.
"We urge the opposition also to fulfill their commitment to the six-point plan and give no excuse for the government to renege on its commitment," Annan said in the letter, noting "The clear declaration coming from the opposition are encouraging in this respect."
"Despite these assurances from the Syrian government, credible reports indicate that during that same period, the Syrian armed forces have conducted rolling military operations in populated centers, characterized by troop movements into towns supported by artillery fire," the letter said.
Annan also said the lack of UN observers makes it hard to monitor the situation on the ground, as "the rapid increase of refugee flows into Turkey gives a strong indication of a surge in violence."
He noted that the new Syrian requests which constitute "ex post facto requirements that are not part of the six-point plan which they agreed to implement", put at risk the cessation of all violence that must take place on 12 April at 0600 a.m. "If the required political will is present and the implementation of the six-point plan can proceed as agreed, the cessation of violence of 12 April will need to be followed in short order by the deployment of an effective international monitoring mechanisms," Annan said, adding this will require quick action from the Security Council to "create the necessary conditions for an inclusive political solution that meets the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people."
