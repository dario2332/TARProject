  <text>Troops launch assault on Damascus suburb
�Syrian troops launched a fierce assault on a Damascus suburb on Thursday, days ahead of a deadline for a UN-brokered cease-fire, with activists describing it as one of the most violent attacks around the capital since the year-old uprising began.The operation in Douma, along with other offensives around the country, bolstered the opposition's claim that President Bashar Assad is only intensifying violence ahead of the April 10 deadline to implement a cease-fire. Activists say Assad wants to make gains on the ground before the truce is supposed to take effect.Douma-based activist Mohammed Saeed reported that troops shelled residential areas with tanks "in one of the most violent campaigns against the area since the uprising started." He said troops were using detainees as human shields as they marched into one of the suburb's main squares, a few miles northwest of Damascus."Soldiers in the Ghanam Square near the vegetable market were walking behind detainees," Saeed said via Skype. "They do that so that members of the Free Syrian Army do not open fire at the troops."The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported one of the biggest operations of the uprising in Douma, where army defectors are believed to be active.The truce is the keystone of a plan put forward by former UN chief Kofi Annan in his role as joint UN-Arab League envoy in an effort to end bloodshed that the UN says has claimed more than 9,000 lives since March 2011. Annan's spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said both sides are expected to end the hostilities within 48 hours of the April 10th deadline. Annan's plan requires regime forces to withdraw from towns and cities, followed by a withdrawal by rebel fighters. Then all sides are supposed to hold talks on a political solution.Also on Thursday, Russia said it could support a UN Security Council motion on Syria if it doesn' contain ultimatums to Assad's government.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on a trip to Kyrgyzstan that Moscow may vote in favour of a Security Council document backing UN envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan. Lavrov didn't specify whether he was referring to a Council resolution or a statement, but warned that the document shouldn't contain any ultimatums or threats.Russia and China have twice used their veto power at the Council to block UN resolutions condemning Assad's government. But Moscow has strongly supported Annan's plan and urged Assad to take the first step to end bloodshed.
