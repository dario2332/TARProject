  <text>At least four people were wounded on Wednesday in clashes between the army and residents of two areas of Lebanon's city of Tripoli supporting opposite sides in the crisis in neighboring Syria, a security official told AFP.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said shooting broke out after soldiers tried to remove barricades in the northern port city's sensitive and mainly Sunni Muslim neighborhood of Bab al-Tebbaneh.
Residents opened fire on the soldiers, one of whom was wounded, and the troops responded.
The clashes then escalated with residents of Jabal Mohsen, which sits opposite Bab al-Tebbaneh, also opening fire.
There were also reports of sniper fire.
Later on Wednesday the National News Agency reported that a number of injured people arrived at the Islamic hospital in Tripoli and were identified as Bilal Dabab, Hilal Dabab, Khaled Hassan, Ibrahim al-Moustafa, Khaled Husein and Ibrahim Turkmani.
It added that Mouzher al-Mouswal, aged 70, was killed in a car accident while attempting to flee the area of the clashes.Jabal Mohsen is populated mainly by Alawites loyal to the embattled regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Bab al-Tebbaneh residents support the opposition seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Deadly clashes broke out on Saturday in Tripoli between Islamists and the army as young demonstrators, sympathizers of the revolt in Syria, tried to approach the offices of the pro-Assad Syrian Social Nationalist Party. The clashes followed the arrest of Lebanese citizen Shadi al-Mawlawi by General Security. After his arrest, 100 young men blocked the northern and southern roads into Tripoli.
The ensuing sectarian clashes between residents of the two neighborhoods earlier this week left nine people dead and some 50 wounded.-AFP/NOW Lebanon
