  <text>Twin attacks have killed at least 50 people in Afghanistan. In the first deadliest incident, a suspected suicide bomb went off near a gathering of hundreds of Shias singing at the Abu Fazal shrine, in the capital, Kabul, killing at least 48, women and children among them.
A suspect is thought to come together with pilgrims from the southern province of Logar.
Another blast has hit the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif at about the same time, leaving 4 people killed and 20 more injured.
The attacks coincided with the Shia Muslim festival of Ashura - the most important day in the Shia calendar and marked with a public holiday in Afghanistan. Ashura is the climax of Muharram, the month of mourning for the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson.
