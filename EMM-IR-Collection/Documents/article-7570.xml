  <text>UNITED NATIONS - UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan appealed to the Security Council on Tuesday to use its leverage to prevent the collapse of his efforts to end Syria's year-long conflict after Damascus ignored a deadline to withdraw troops from Syrian towns.
Several Western diplomats complained privately that Damascus appeared to have won a two-day extension after flouting its first deadline under Annan's peace plan. But they said it was vital to keep the 15-nation body, which has faced deep rifts over Syria, united in order to maintain pressure on Damascus.
"Every effort must be made to achieve a cessation of violence in all its forms on 12 April at 6 a.m. (3 a.m. GMT)," Annan told the council in a letter, obtained by Reuters.
"There is no more time to lose," Annan said in a statement to the press. "We must all push for an end to the bloodshed before Syria plunges into the abyss."
US Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, president of the council this month, said all council members voiced "deep concern" at Damascus' level of commitment to its truce pledges. She was speaking to reporters after Annan's deputy Jean-Marie Guehenno briefed the council via video link from Geneva.
Rice added that the council may soon face a "moment of truth" when it will have to decide whether to increase pressure on the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has shown no signs of complying with a Tuesday deadline to withdraw forces from towns and stop using heavy weapons.
Her remarks appeared to be aimed primarily at Russia and China, which have twice vetoed Western- and Arab-backed resolutions condemning Assad's 13-month assault on pro-democracy protesters but have recently supported several council statements backing Annan's six-point peace plan.
"The US view is that it is outrageous but by no means unexpected or surprising that the (Syrian) government has yet again made commitments and broken them," Rice said.
Annan 'gravely concerned' at course of events in Syria
The former UN secretary-general was far from optimistic in his assessment of the situation in Syria, where the United Nations says more than 9,000 people have been killed by Syrian security forces since March 2011. Damascus says rebels have killed more than 2,500 soldiers and security personnel.
"I am gravely concerned at the course of events," Annan said in his letter.
"The days before 10 April should have been an opportunity for the Government of Syria to send a powerful political signal of peace, with action on all aspects of the six-point (peace) plan," he wrote.
