  <text>Appearing beside his Armenian counterpart, Edward Nalbandian, Lavrov said that only  the UN Security Council (in which Russia holds veto power) can establish time limits on Assad's compliance with the peace proposal.
"Annan has a Security Council mandate and it is up to the UN Security Council to decide who is complying with this plan and how," he said.
Over the weekend, at a summit in Istanbul, Turkey, officials from Arab and Western nations indicated they would ask the UN to spell out such a deadline for Assad's compliance. Neither China nor Russia attended the Turkish meeting.
Lavrov explained that he did not got to Istanbul because no one from the Syrian government was invited.
"We are trying to be friends for all Syrians and not only for one part of the Syrian nation," Lavrov said at the Armenian conference.
Meanwhile, the bloodshed continues in Syria - at least 18 people have died in a crackdown of rebel areas in Homs, Aleppo and villages in the northern Idlib province.
At least 9,000 people have died in Syria since the revolt against Assad erupted more than one year ago, according to UN estimates.
