  <text>The rebel Free Syrian Army said after the killings that it was no longer committed to the UN-backed peace plan for Syria unless there was prompt UN intervention to protect civilians.
A member of the opposition Syrian National Council, Ausama Monajed, condemned the surge in violence:
"It is beyond humanity what we've seen last night, what Assad militiamen are capable of doing and are willing to do to retain their grip on power," he said.
"It is utterly unacceptable that this is happening on the UN monitoring mission watch."
The plan drawn up by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan technically began on April 12, but violence and bloodshed have not stopped and a ceasefire that formed part of the plan has been breached daily.
France's new foreign minister Laurent Fabius said he was making immediate arrangements for the Friends of Syria nations - which include Britain but not key UN players China and Russia - to meet in Paris.
"I condemn the atrocities committed daily by Bashar al-Assad on his own people," Mr Fabius said. "With these new crimes his murderous regime plunges Syria further into horror and threatens regional stability."
Mr Fabius said he would speak to Mr Annan on Sunday, adding: "In the face of horror, the international community must mobilise still further to stop the martyrdom of the Syrian people."
German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said he was "shocked and horrified" at the killings.
"It is appalling that the Syrian regime does not put an end to the brutal violence against its own people," Mr Westerwelle said in a statement.
"Those responsible for this crime must be punished."
