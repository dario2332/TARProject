At least 11 civilians and four government troops were killed in clashes across the country, according to Syrian residents and members of Avaaz, a global organization that supports independent press in conflict areas. The Syrian military continued to shell neighborhoods in the western city of Homs and in several towns in northern Idlib province, while clashes took place in the suburbs of Damascus.
Syrian troops were ferried to the city of Zabadani, outside Damascus, and to southern Deraa province to conduct raids on rebel homes Tuesday morning, according to accounts by activist groups and a resident in each area.
If true, that would mark a violation of the six-point international peace plan brokered last week by former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a joint envoy of the U.N. and the Arab League.
President Bashar al-Assad's government agreed Monday to a timeline to the plan, which requires it to immediately begin halting its forward deployments and use of heavy weapons, and to complete a withdrawal of troops from population centers by by April 10. Within 48 hour after that, the plan calls for rebel forces to pull out from towns and cities.
Syria's ambassador to the U.N. blamed Saudi Arabia and Qatar for complicating the crisis. The two are among Gulf states that have called for arming Syrian rebels and that agreed over the weekend to fund salaries for opposition fighters.
"Those countries are violating Syrian sovereignty and declaring the war on it...They have to assume responsibilities and commit to Annan's mission," Bashar Ja'affri said in comments published Tuesday by Syria's Sana state news agency, adding that these Gulf states' hawkish stance "contradicts the harmonious way adopted by the Security Council."
Anti-regime activists say Mr. Assad is using the peace deal to buy time and crush the rebellion, pointing to past agreements the Syrian government has violated.
An advance U.N. peacekeeping team is expected in Damascus in the next two days to discuss deploying observers to monitor the cease-fire.
The peacekeepers are part of Mr. Annan's six-point plan, which the Syrian government has agreed to but has so far not implemented. Part of that plan would see a daily, two-hour cease-fire implemented immediately to provide humanitarian aid to the thousands of civilians caught in the violence.
Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee for the Red Cross is meeting top government officials in Damascus on Tuesday to appeal for the immediate implementation of the two-hour ceasefire, access to detention centers and expansion of the aid group's presence around the country.
"A daily pause in the hostilities is essential in order to evacuate wounded people and deliver aid if and when the fighting intensifies," said ICRC president Jakob Kellenberger. "I am determined to see the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent expand their presence, range and scope of activities to address the needs of vulnerable people."
Mr. Kellenberger was due to meet the ministers of foreign affairs, interior and health, his spokesman said.
Civilians appear to be suffering a deep toll as Syria's conflict enters a second year. Syrian troops raided a refugee safe house in Taftanaz, a town in Idlib province, looking for rebels among the women and children seeking shelter there Tuesday afternoon, residents said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based activist group, said this week that more than 10,000 people have been killed in the year-long violence. The U.N. has estimated the death toll stands at more than 9,000.
Once-peaceful opposition activists are growing frustrated with the U.N.'s so-far failed efforts to get Mr. Assad to implement the peace deal and are calling for more arms instead.
