At least seven people were killed and three others injured when a gunman opened fire at a Christian college in California.
Five people were killed on the spot and two others were declared dead at the hospital after what was described as one of the deadliest campus shootings in the US in five years.
The shooter has been identified as 43-year-old Korean-American One Goh, a former student of the Oikos University. The suspect later surrendered at a supermarket in nearby Alameda city.
According to the police, he acted alone and used a handgun, but the motive behind the shooting still remains unknown to the investigators.
