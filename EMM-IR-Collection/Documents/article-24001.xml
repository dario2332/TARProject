  <text>Young men blocked the international highway in Tripoli’s Bab al-Tabbaneh, which links the northern city to the capital, Beirut, the National News Agency reported on Sunday.
“Other young men blocked the road leading to Abdel Hamid Karami Square [in Tripoli],” the NNA said, adding that both actions were to protest the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and his body guard.
Army troops shot dead a Sunni cleric, Abdel Wahed, on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed.-NOW Lebanon
