  <text>Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea condemned the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and called for non-involvement in a scheme that seeks to spark a conflict, according to a statement issued by the LF’s press office.
“[Geagea] called on all religious and civil figures as well as citizens to not [allow themselves to] get involved in [schemes that seek to cause strife] and a confrontation between the Lebanese army and people,” the statement said.
“[No one] should get involved into strife even if it is proven that a mistake was committed by army members,” he added.
The statement added that Geagea offered his condolences to Akkar’s Sunni Mufti, Sheikh Osama Rifai and Tripoli’s Sunni Mufti, Sheikh Malek Chaar as well as to Akkar residents for the murder of Abdel Wahed.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed.
