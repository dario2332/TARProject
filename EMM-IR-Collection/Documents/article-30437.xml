HELSINKI (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire from a rooftop in a Finnish town centre in the early hours of Saturday, killing an 18-year-old woman and wounding eight other people, police said.
An 18-year-old man wearing camouflage clothing was detained several hours after the shooting outside bars and restaurants in Hyvinkaa, a small town 56 km (34 miles) north of the capital Helsinki, just before 2 a.m. (11.00 p.m. British time).
The motive for the shooting was unclear. It followed a series of shooting sprees in Finland in recent years and came less than a year after anti-immigrant gunman Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a rampage in neighbouring Norway.
The police's regional chief inspector, Timo Leppala, said the suspect was detained peacefully. He was believed to have used two rifles and acted alone. He had no criminal background, police said.
Two of the wounded are in critical condition. One of them is a policewoman.
Finland has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the world and a series of mass shootings prompted the government to toughen its gun laws last June. The suspect in Saturday's case did not have a license, police said.
In November 2007, an 18-year-old student killed eight people at a high school near Helsinki before turning the weapon on himself. The following September, a 22 year-old killed 10 people in a small western town of Kauhajoki before shooting himself.
In December 2009, a man shot four people dead in a shopping mall in Espoo after knifing his ex-girlfriend to death. The man later killed himself.
