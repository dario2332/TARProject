Mohamed Merah - the man behind the Toulouse killing spree – is dead after a 32 hour siege ended in grenade explosions and gunfire.
The Toulouse gunman suspected of murdering seven people, including three children at a Jewish school, remains barricaded in his house. He admits to the killings and has agreed to surrender "late this evening," according to the French prosecutor.
A teacher and three students were killed when a man opened fire on parents and children waiting outside a school in Toulouse. Two incidents of “striking similarity” left three French soldiers dead last week.

A Bomb blast has struck a school in the southern Italian city of Brindisi, killing two students and injuring several others. The explosion hit as students arrived for morning lessons at the institute.
Local authorities report that three incendiary devices were planted in a trash bin in front of Morvillo Falcone school.
One student died of her injuries shortly after being taken to hospital, while the second died during surgery as doctors fought to save her life.
“I was opening the window when I felt the force of the blast. I saw children thrown to the floor, blackened by the explosion, their books on fire. A truly terrifying scene. Who could’ve have done such a thing?” said a witness of the blast to Italian newspaper "La Repubblica."
The explosion went off at around 8am local time (06:00 GMT), causing widespread panic among the students arriving at the school.
The building has now been evacuated and cordoned off for police investigation.
It is unclear who was behind the attacks although initial suspicions were directed at the local mafia.
Security has been stepped up throughout Italy after a recent shooting which wounded a nuclear energy official. The anarchist group “The International Revolutionary Front” who claimed responsibility for the attack has also threatened to attack a number of key politicians including Italian PM Mario Monti.
The spiraling economic crisis and harsh austerity measures have raised fears of an increase in political violence across the country.
The Pentagon has accused China of being the world’s number one cyber aggressor, carrying out attacks on US systems. A released military report says “China’s persistent cyber intrusions” are a significant threat to US economic security.
