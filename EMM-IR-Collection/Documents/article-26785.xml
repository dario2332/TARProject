  <text>Career diplomat helped craft partnership agreement for US-Afghan ties but leaves with many of its details undefined
The US ambassador to Afghanistan is to step down after just a year in the job, leaving behind a hard-won deal defining long-term relations between Kabul and Washington but a tangle of other challenges for his successor.
The state department said Ryan Crocker, a career diplomat who came out of retirement to take charge of the embassy in Kabul last July, is leaving because of health reasons.
Crocker was tasked with trying to reset an often tense and acrimonious relationship as a gradual drawdown of US combat forces got under way. Victoria Nuland, the state department spokeswoman, said he would leave in "midsummer".
Nuland highlighted his "enormous achievements" including the strategic partnership agreement that sets a framework for US-Afghan ties beyond the 2014 departure of combat troops, and two deals on Afghan prisons and special operations that paved the way for the wider pact.
"These achievements are the guarantee that as Afghanistan moves to a brighter future secured by its own capabilities, it does so in sovereign and equal partnership with the United States in particular and the international community generally," Crocker said.
But that deal has left some of the toughest questions to be hammered out later, among them US access to military bases in Afghanistan, and the legal status of any soldiers that stay on after the Nato-led combat mission finishes at the end of 2014.
There are other major challenges facing efforts to shore up the civilian government in Kabul and ward off fears the country could fall into another civil war. Efforts to reach a political settlement with the Taliban are faltering, and there is little sign of progress on promised Afghan government efforts to tackle massive graft.
Crocker's departure may also be followed by that of the top US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, general John Allen, according to Reuters news agency. The Obama administration is considering sending him to head US forces in Europe this winter, the agency said this month, citing anonymous sources.
The turnover of the top civilian and military leaders of the US effort in Afghanistan, before either man completed his term, would further complicate the transition to full Afghan control of security, at a time when cash for development spending is also being heavily cut.
Crocker, who previously served as US ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, warned near the start of his posting in Kabul that he thought the US would have to spend a lot more time and billions more dollars in Afghanistan.
Crocker had retired from the government in April 2009, becoming dean of the Bush school of government and public service at Texas A&amp;;M University.
