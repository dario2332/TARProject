  <text>A UN observer convoy was bombed Tuesday at a Syrian funeral procession, the opposition said, as the United Nations reported its vehicles were hit but that staff escaped unharmed in apparently the same attack.
At least 20 people were killed and dozens wounded when Syrian regime forces opened fire on a funeral procession in Edleb province during a visit by UN monitors, a watchdog said.
"The Syrian regime committed a massacre Tuesday during a visit by UN monitors to Khan Sheikhun," in the northwestern province, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Separately, UN spokesperson Martin Nesirky said a roadside bomb exploded in front of a convoy of UN ceasefire monitors in Khan Sheikhun, but no injuries were reported among UN workers.
The convoy hit the bomb just after 2:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), Nesirky told reporters, adding that three out of the four UN vehicles in the convoy were damaged.
A video uploaded to YouTube by activists showed a convoy of UN vehicles surrounded by dozens of people before a blast was heard and a puff of smoke went up in front of the leading UN-marked jeep.
It was unclear from the footage if anybody was injured, and the jeep was driven off despite having its front hood damaged. The authenticity of the video could not be verified.
Activists said the four-vehicle UN convoy in Khan Sheikhun had come under attack and one car was hit by a shell, prompting the monitors to quickly leave the area.
Major Sami al-Kurdi, a spokesperson for the rebel Free Syrian Army, told AFP that the monitors had arrived during the funeral and that their presence had encouraged more mourners to turn out and join the procession.
"The regime dared to attack the procession, however, and then targeted the vehicles of the UN observers from a regime checkpoint," he said.
The Observatory, a Britain-based rights watchdog, called for an international probe into the killings that took place during the funeral of a man killed the day before.
It also urged the 200-strong UN monitoring mission overseeing a tenuous ceasefire in Syria to launch its own investigation.-AFP/NOW Lebanon
