One demonstrator was killed in Assi square in the city of Hama when government 
  forces opened fire on demonstrators despite agreeing to an UN-brokered 
  ceasefire, sources in Hama told the Britain-based Syrian 
  Observatory for Human Rights.
International envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan went into effect 
  Thursday morning. An outbreak of violence could undermine the ceasefire 
  agreement that aims for a peaceful resolution to end the bloody 13-month 
  uprising through diplomatic discussions.
Security forces were out in strength to control the anti-Assad rallies, 
  demanding protesters obtain permits for the right to rally in the streets.
Syrian forces tightened security in public squares and around mosques.
Another protester was shot dead after leaving a mosque to join anti-Assad 
  protests in the village of Nawa, in the southern province of Daraa, the

The Annan plan allows the Syrian people to hold peaceful protests.
Syrian forces also killed a man in the town of Salqin, in the northwestern 
  province of Idlib near the Turkish border, as troops loyal to Assad attempt 
  to clear rebels out of the area, the Observatory added.
Government forces deployed tanks to the village of Kherbet Joz, near the 
  border of Turkey, where there has been heavy gunfire, the anti-Assad 
  committees reported.
A contingent of 10 to 12 people UN observers are ready to board a plane to 
  Syria, the spokesman for Annan said on Friday.
The advance team is "standing by to board planes and to get themselves on 
  the ground as soon as possible" in anticipation that the UN security 
  council will grant approval for the mission, Annan's spokesman Ahmad Fawzi 
  told a news conference in Geneva on Friday.
The UN estimated that government forces have killed at least 9,000 Syrian 
  people since the violent uprising against Assad began last year.
