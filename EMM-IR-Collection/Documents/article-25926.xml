  <text>A soldier accused of planning to bomb American troops stationed at Fort Hood in Texas wore a mask in court for the first time as jury selection began in his trial.
Private Naser Jason Abdo has been accused of biting through his lip and spitting blood on a deputy US marshal and a sheriff's deputy who were escorting him after a court hearing last month.
Officials reported a previous blood-spitting incident on a jailer.
Abdo, 22, wore an oval mask over his nose and mouth, while several US marshals standing near him wore protective glasses. McLennan County sheriff Larry Lynch said he could not comment on why Abdo was wearing a mask.
Abdo, a Muslim soldier who was absent without leave from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, is accused of planning to bomb a Killeen restaurant filled with Fort Hood soldiers and shoot any survivors last summer.
Jury selection started on Monday at his federal trial in Waco, about 50 miles north east of Killeen, the city just outside Fort Hood.
Abdo faces a sentence up to life in prison if convicted of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, the most serious of the six charges on which he is being tried.
He is not being tried in military court. His lawyers are not seeking an insanity defence.
After his first court appearance last July, Abdo shouted: "Nidal Hasan Fort Hood 2009!" It was an apparent homage to Major Nidal Hasan, a US army psychiatrist charged in that shooting rampage that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen.
Hasan's military trial is to start in August at the Texas army post.
