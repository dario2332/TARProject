  <text>BEIRUT, Lebanon &amp;mdash; An initial team of six United Nations military observers arrived in Syria on Monday to monitor compliance with the fragile, four-day-old cease-fire negotiated by the special envoy Kofi Annan, his spokesman said, as activists reported government shelling in Homs, Hama and other areas.

The monitors were ready to start patrols as early as Monday, depending on the cooperation of the Syrian government, said Ahmad Fawzi, the spokesman for Mr. Annan, the main architect of the truce under United Nations auspices. The team, drawn from military missions in the region, was to be joined by 24 more monitors within days. They are the advance guard of a contingent expected to grow to 250 after further negotiations with Syria.
The observers "will start with setting up operating headquarters and reaching out to the Syrian government and the opposition forces so that both sides fully understand" their role, Mr. Fawzi said in a statement.
Opinion on the streets of Damascus was mixed. Government supporters, remembering how United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq wanted access to even Saddam Hussein's private quarters, fretted that the force would become intrusive.
"I have no trust in the U.N. and its organizations, which did nothing good for Arabs," said Ali, 40, a government employee and member of President Bashar al-Assad's minority Alawite sect, which has remained staunchly behind the president. He, like many interviewed would give only first names, out of fear of retribution. "Russia is standing with Syria, but its recent position was not strong, as it was a few months ago," Ali added.
On the other side, supporters of the uprising wondered whether even the full contingent of 250 observers would be enough to track the cease-fire, and they pointed out that the presence of Arab League monitors in January had not stopped the violence.
"The Syrian government was forced to accept those observers," said Abu Abdu, a 30-year-old interviewed in central Damascus. "I think this mission will be the last opportunity for a peaceful and political solution to the Syrian crisis."
Another man, Mohamed, a 25-year-old student, said an embattled province like Dara'a, where the uprising started in March 2011, would probably need 50 observers alone to follow all the violence in the various hamlets. "The Annan plan has six points, and we want to see the implementation of the six, not a partial cease-fire," he said.
Reports from around Syria suggested that the cease-fire, which went into effect on Thursday, was holding in places, with notable exceptions.
A video posted online that was said to have been shot Sunday in Homs's central Khaldiya neighborhood showed a building going up in flames after a shell hit it. The whizzing of shells overhead could be heard every few minutes.
In the north, government forces were also barraging the village of Khirbet al-Jouz, aiming at a group of fighters from the Free Syrian Army there, said a statement for the Local Coordination Committees, an activist group.
At least 10 Syrian civilians were killed, according to activist organizations. Those reports could not be confirmed.
The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, a force within the Syrian National Council, the main umbrella group for the opposition, issued a statement saying that the Annan plan should not be open-ended but rather require a timetable for the political transition it envisions. "We stress that continuing to carry out Annan's plan without a time limit, while the other side maintains its killing and violations will be a means of mocking the lives of the Syrian people," it said.
As they have every day under the cease-fire, demonstrators in modest numbers took to the streets in towns and cities across Syria to demand the end of Mr. Assad's rule.
The United Nations' decision to send the advance team of observers was the first time since the Syrian uprising began that the Security Council was united in demanding a halt to the violence. Russia and China had either vetoed or sought to dilute previous efforts.
The resolution required Syria to withdraw its security forces from population centers and to begin a dialogue with the opposition, both key parts of the six-point plan designed to end more than a year of violence that has left at least 9,000 people dead, by the United Nations' count.
