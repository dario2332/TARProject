  <text>BEIRUT: Forces loyal to President Bashar Assad shelled the battered Syrian city of Homs on Saturday, killing one person, opposition activists said, in the first such shelling since a ceasefire began two days ago.
The United Nations Security Council is tentatively scheduled to vote on a Western-Arab draft resolution authorizing an advance U.N. team to monitor the fragile ceasefire which aims to end 13 months of bloodshed during the uprising against Assad.
"There was shelling last night in the old part of the city, in Jouret al-Shiyah and al-Qarabis. And I have heard eight shells fall in the past hour," Karm Abu Rabea, a resident activist who lives in an adjacent neighborhood, said.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR)said shelling had killed one person and wounded several people overnight.
Activist Walid al-Fares showed Reuters footage of a thick pillar of smoke rising next to a mosque minaret and said Syrian forces had fired mortar rounds. The crack of gunfire could also be heard.
An opposition source, who asked to remain anonymous as he feared retaliation from his own side, said that army shelling came after rebels ambushed government troops in the city on Friday night.
The Syrian government repeatedly has denied access to journalists, making it impossible to verify the reports independently.
In a video, reportedly filmed in the Hay al-Etha neighborhood of Aleppo, the sound of gunfire and an explosion can be heard as men holding the Syrian revolutionary flag and children scatter from what appears to be a demonstration.
SANA said: "Armed terrorist groups spread in Hay al-Etha, opened fire randomly and attacked public and private property."
The station said "armed terrorists" also killed two people on Saturday in the cities of Deir al-Zor and Deraa and kidnapped an army colonel in the central city of Hama.
"Colonel Mohammed Awad car was intercepted by a terrorist group and he was kidnapped at gunpoint," SANA said.
Activist video showed Syrians in cities across the country involved in small demonstrations on Saturday.
Hopes that the truce would put an end to the bullets that have frightened off peaceful protesters for months were quashed when forces loyal to Assad shot dead five protesters after Friday prayers, activists reported.
They said that security forces came out in strength in many cities to prevent protesters from mounting major rallies against Assad.
International pressure has grown for Syria to fulfill all its commitments to peace envoy Kofi Annan by withdrawing troops and heavy weapons, permitting humanitarian and media access, releasing prisoners and discussing a political transition.
In the revised draft, wording has been changed and weakened slightly, in some cases from "demands" to "calls upon" or "requests".
The council will reconvene on Saturday at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT).
