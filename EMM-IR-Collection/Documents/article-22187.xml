  <text>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama says the G-8 economic summit will target both management of the European debt crisis and a "strong growth agenda."
Obama spoke in the Oval Office following his first meeting with new French President Francois Hollande (frahn-SWAH' oh-LAWND'). Obama says he and Hollande agreed that the eurozone crisis is of extraordinary importance to the world economy.
Hollande took office this week following conservative Nicolas Sarkozy's ouster by voters frustrated by his handling of the economy.
Later Friday, Obama and Hollande will join other world leaders at the G-8 at Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains.
