A statement agreed by the 15-member council condemned the massacre last Friday "in the strongest possible terms".
Significantly, Russia signed up to the wording - it has previously tried to water down criticism of Damascus.
The statement said the attacks "involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood" and again demanded President Bashar al Assad withdraw heavy weapons from Syrian towns.
"The Security Council also condemned the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse," the statement, which was read out after the
council's three-hour emergency meeting by Azerbaijan's Deputy UN Ambassador Tofig Musayev, went on.
It added: "Such outrageous use of force against civilian population constitutes a violation of applicable international law and of the commitments of the Syrian Government under United Nations Security Council Resolutions."
Earlier, Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "absolutely sickened" by the attack - one of the bloodiest in Syria's 14-month-old uprising against President Assad's regime.
Mr Hague is flying to Russia to urge its leaders to take a more robust approach to Syria.
The Security Council was told 116 people were killed in Houla, according to figures based on information from the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA).
UN monitors have confirmed at least 108 dead including 49 children and at least seven women.
Major General Robert Mood, head of the UN mission in Syria, reportedly told members most of the deaths were from shrapnel and gunfire at "point-blank" range, and that a further 300 people were injured.
Britain's UN ambassador Mark Lyall-Grant said the Security Council statement, while important, was not enough.
"Over the next two days, the Council will be meeting again to discuss in more detail what steps need to be taken," he told reporters.
UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan is to brief the Security Council on the Syria crisis at a meeting on Wednesday.
UN leader Ban Ki-moon told members the Houla massacre had added to pressure on its observers, as some in the conflict-stricken country blame them for an increase in violence.
"United Nations observers are facing increasing criticism for not stopping the violence and, in some quarters, even being blamed for an increase," Mr Ban said in a letter.
"There is a misconception, difficult to correct, about the role of unarmed military observers and what they can and cannot do," he added.
"This puts the United Nations presence on the ground in a perilous position both with regard to the ability to conduct operations and to the observers' personal security."
There are now more than 280 UN observers in Syria monitoring the cessation of hostilities, which officially started on April 12.
