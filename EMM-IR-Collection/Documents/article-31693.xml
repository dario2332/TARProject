  <text>UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Bashar Ja'afari, the Syrian permanent representative to the United Nations, said here Sunday that the Friday and Saturday massacre in Syira, in which 108 people were confirmed dead by the UN observers, is "appalling and unjustifiable."
"The massacre is an appalling and unjustified, and unjustifiable crime," Ja'afari told reporters here. "This massacre was condemned by my government in the strongest terms possible."
Ja'afari made the statement outside the chamber of the UN Security Council shortly after the 15-nation council issued a press statement to condemn the massacre, in which 108 people were killed, and 32 of them children under the age of 10.
He said that those responsible for the crime will be brought to justice by the Syrian government according to the Syrian law.
Syria on Sunday denied the involvement of the government troops in the deadly carnage in the central village of Houla two days ago, blaming "hundreds of heavily armed gunmen" who also attacked soldiers in the area for the killings.
Meanwhile, the Syrian UN ambassador also asked the Security Council to discuss the problem of those who are "arming, financing, training and protecting the armed terrorist groups" which Damascus blamed for the violence and killings in Syria in order to bring those who are responsible for what he termed as the crimes to justice.
Earlier on Sunday, the UN Security Council condemned "in the strongest possible terms" the killings of 108 people in Syria, saying that those responsible for the massacre should be held accountable.
"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest possible terms the killings, confirmed by United Nations observers, of dozens of men, women and children and the wounding of hundreds more in the village of El-Houleh (Houla), near Homs, in attacks that involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood," said a press statement issued by the 15-nation Security Council at the end of a closed door emergency meeting that began here on Sunday afternoon.
"The members of the Security Council also condemned the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse," the statement said. "The members of the Security Council extended their profound sympathies and sincere condolences to the families of the victims, and underscored their grave concern about the situation of civilians in Syria," the statement said.
