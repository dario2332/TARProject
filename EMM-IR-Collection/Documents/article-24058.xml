  <text>Akkar MPs and mufti held a meeting in the northern city of Halba to discuss the situation following the murder of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed and called for taking “strict measures” against the officers and members who opened fire on Abdel Wahed, the National News Agency reported.
“[The participants] issued a statement read by [Future bloc MP] Khaled al-Daher and offered condolences to Akkar residents for the [death of Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard],” the report said.
The statement condemned “targeting [Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard] and considered their murder premeditated.”
It also said that the responsibility did not fall on who committed the crime but on who gave the orders to open fire.
“Some army officers are biased for a certain party. [Therefore] any investigation carried out by the army command or its members is rejected,” Daher said.
He added that the participants will call for establishing a parliamentary commission to address the issue and called on Akkar residents to maintain calm and prevent strife “which the Syrian regime threatened with.”
Daher added that closing roads did not serve citizens: “This will not last and it will stop soon.”
Meanwhile, Akkar’s Sunni Mufti, Sheikh Osama Rifai, called for not harming the Lebanese army.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed.Their murder sparked tension in Akkar and Tripoli where some young men blocked roads.
