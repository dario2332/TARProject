Syrian troops defied a U.N.-brokered cease-fire plan on Tuesday, launching fresh attacks on rebellious areas, but special envoy Kofi Annan said there was still time to salvage a truce that he described as the only chance for peace.
Residents of Homs reported some of the heaviest shelling in months.
The U.N. estimates more than 9,000 people have been killed since the uprising began, and the toll climbs every day. Regime forces assault their opponents with tanks, machine guns and snipers, and the Free Syrian Army rebel group launches frequent attacks against government targets, killing soldiers and security forces.
Russia and China had blocked strong action by the U.N. Security Council, giving Assad a significant layer of protection as his crackdown continues.
Annan, working on behalf of the U.N. and the Arab League, secured the support of Russia and China for his cease-fire plan, and he went to Iran on Tuesday to press officials there for support as well.
But a swift halt to the fighting is unrealistic, analysts say.
The priority must be to keep the conflict from getting worse, the report said.
Still, critics have accused Assad of playing for time since he accepted the six-point truce agreement on March 27.
Soon after the deadline was agreed, regime forces stepped up attacks on opponents.
The regime also began making last-minute demands.
On Sunday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said the military could not withdraw without written guarantees that the rebels would lay down their arms. He raised another condition Tuesday, saying that the cease-fire must start simultaneously with the deployment of the international observer mission.
In his news conference, Annan said violence must stop without preconditions.
On Tuesday, during a visit to Moscow, Moallem said the Syrian military was withdrawing from some areas.
On the ground, activists said there were scant signs that the regime was withdrawing.
Syrian tanks and soldiers remained in most major flashpoint towns and cities across the country, with military operations reported in the Damascus suburbs, the central regions of Homs and Hama, Idlib and Aleppo in the north and Daraa in the south.
Syrian activists said dozens of people were killed across the country, including up to 19 troops killed in rebel ambushes or in clashes with opposition forces.
