  <text>The trial of Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in bomb and gun attacks in Norway, began on April 16.
Breivik, 33, arrived at an Oslo courthouse under armed guard on Monday, clenching his fist in a far-right salute and saying he did not recognise the authority of the judges as 'they got their political mandate from forces that support multiculturalism." He said he did not accept legal culpability for the murders, which he claims were necessary to protect Norway from being taken over by Muslims.
Around 150 people are expected to testify in the trial, with more than 770 survivors and their families being represented by 162 lawyers.
Breivik's defence lawyer is Geir Lppestad.
If convicted, he would face a maximum sentence of 21 years in prison, though sentences can be extended if a criminal is considered a menace to society. If declared insane by the court, he would be committed to psychiatric care. Both sides can appeal the ruling to a higher court.
Breivik is charged with terrorism and premeditated murder for a bombing in Oslo's government district, killing eight, and a shooting attack at a political youth camp, killing 69.
