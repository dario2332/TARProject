  <text>BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi officials say three separate bomb attacks have rocked Baghdad early in the morning, killing six and wounding 21 people.
Two police officers say a parked car bomb exploded around 7:30 a.m. in the northern Shiite neighborhood of Kazimiyah, killing three and wounding 11 people.
Another police officer says a roadside bomb went off minutes later as daily laborers were gathering in the southwestern Shiite Amil area. Two died and eight were injured in that attack.
And in the southeastern Zafaraniyah neighborhood, a roadside bomb killed one and wounded two people. Hospital doctors confirmed the causality figures from Thursday's attacks.
All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to releases information.
