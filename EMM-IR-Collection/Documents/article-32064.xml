  <text>Britain warned on Monday that failure by the two sides in Syria to implement UN envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan could lead to "all-out civil war and collapse" in the violence-torn country.
"It is not as if the alternatives in Syria are the Annan plan or the Assad regime retaking control of the country," Hague said after talks in Moscow with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
"The alternatives are the Annan plan or ever increasing chaos in Syria and the descent closer and closer to all-out civil war and collapse."
Hague said he urged Russia to put more pressure on the government of its Soviet-era ally to keep to the terms of Annan's six-point proposal.
"It is urgent to make every effort to start the political process and to encourage – of course, we must all encourage – the Assad regime to implement the plan they have not yet implemented.”
"I think that Russia has an important role to play in that, as we discussed today," Hague said.
