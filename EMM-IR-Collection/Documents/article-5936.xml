Beirut - A United Nations advance team Thursday discussed  with Syrian officials the deployment of peace observers, as activists  reported fresh violence in several parts of the country.
'The team is already in Syria. They are the guests of the Syrian  government. Their talks are being held at the Foreign Ministry,' UN  spokesman in Syria Khaled al-Masri told dpa. He declined to give  further details.
A UN source has said Major General Robert Mood from Norway, who  has vast experience in peacekeeping missions, will be heading the  observer mission once a ceasefire is in place.
'The focus of the UN team's talks is on the logistics, once a  ceasefire is implemented, and where the monitors will be positioned,'  a Western diplomat based in Beirut told dpa.
'There will be some 250-300 observers and the UN has already  started to ask member states if they would like to send troops to  participate in the mission,' the diplomat said on condition of  anonymity.
The Syrian government has said it has accepted an April 10  ceasefire as part of a peace plan proposed by UN-Arab League envoy  Kofi Annan.
The UN Security Council Thursday urged Syria to carry out the plan  'urgently and visibly.'
The plan calls on the Syrian government to pull back its troops  and heavy weapons from civilian areas, and for all parties, including  the opposition, to cease armed violence within 48 hours of this  withdrawal.
It also calls for the release of detainees, access to humanitarian  services, and talks between the Syrian government and opposition
Ahmed Fawzi, Anan's spokesman, said Thursday that Damascus had  informed the UN that troops started to pull out of some areas.
Officials in the Syrian government 'told us they have begun  withdrawing troops from certain areas,' Fawzi told dpa by phone.
'The clock starts on April 10 for both sides to cease all forms of  violence,' he told a news briefing in Geneva on Thursday.
Syrian state media reported troop withdrawal from some areas in  Daraa in the south, Idlib in the north, and Zabadani on the outskirts  of Damascus. The opposition has called into question the reported  pullback.
'What kind of a withdrawal is the regime talking about?' Waldi al-  Buni, a Syrian opposition politician, said.
'Today there are military operations across Syria and more  reinforcements on the ground,' he added.
At least eight Syrian soldiers were killed in fierce fighting with  army defectors in the district of Deir Balaba in the volatile  province of Homs, reported the opposition Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights.
Seven civilians were killed Thursday in government shelling of the  province, added the Britain-based group.
Activist near Damascus, meanwhile, told dpa that military troops  had attacked the city's suburban area of Douma, in what was described  as the worst assault on the area since an anti-government uprising  started in March 2011.
'The regime is now focusing on Douma because they believe a number  of the opposition Syrian Free Army are hiding inside the area and are  planning for attacks inside the capital,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, the  head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The observatory said troops had clashed with army defectors in the  northern towns of Hraytan and Anadan near Syria's third largest city  of Aleppo.
Three people were killed in the fighting, it added.
News from Syria is hard to verify as the government bars most  foreign media from restive areas.
More than 9,000 people have been killed in Syria since the  conflict started, according to the UN.
