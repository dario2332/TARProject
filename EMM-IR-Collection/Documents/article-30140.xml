President Bashar Assad's forces killed at least 50 civilians, including 13 children, in central Syria today, activists said.
It is one of the highest death tolls in one specific area since an internationally-brokered cease-fire went into effect last month.
Syrian troops using tanks, mortars and heavy machine guns pounded the area of Houla, a region made up of several towns and villages in the province of Homs, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Co-ordination Committees activist groups said.
Both groups said at least 50 people were killed.
Reports cannot be independently verified as the Syrian government has banned international media from the country.
The Observatory, which has a network of activists around the country, said the dead included 13 children.
It added that about 100 people were wounded.
An amateur video posted online by activists showed more than a dozen bodies lined up inside a room.
They included about 10 children who were covered with sheets that only showed their bloodied faces.
"Houla was subjected to a massacre," a man could be heard saying inside the room.
The Observatory said in one incident in Houla, a family of six was killed when their home received a direct hit.
The UN said several weeks ago that 9,000 people have been killed in Syria in the past 15 months. Hundreds more have died since.
