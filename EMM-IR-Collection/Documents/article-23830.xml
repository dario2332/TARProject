  <text>TIRIN KOT, Afghanistan, May 20 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were killed Sunday when a suicide bombing rocked Tirin Kot city, the provincial capital of southern Afghan province of Uruzgan, a police source said.
"Six children were injured when a terrorist blew his explosive- laden vest up near the gate of the first police sub-district department in Tirin Kot city when a group of U.S. soldiers with the NATO-led troops were leaving the compound," a provincial police spokesman Farid Ayal told Xinhua.
Meantime, General Salim Ehsas, commander of 404 Maiwand Police Zone in southern Afghanistan, told Xinhua that three U.S. soldiers with the NATO-led troops were injured in the attack which occurred at around 11:30 a.m. local time.
The injured children were transferred to a hospital in provincial capital, spokesman Ayal said, adding the blast also damaged a number of shops and houses around the explosion site.
He blamed Taliban for the attack.
The Taliban insurgent group, which has been waging a decade- long insurgency, announced on May 2 that they would launched a spring offensive starting from May 3 to target Afghan forces as well as U.S. and NATO troops across the country.
They asked the civilians to stay away from official gatherings, military convoys and centers regarded as the legitimate targets by militants, while warning people against supporting government and foreign troops.
Taliban also carried out a suicide attack against a police checkpoint in eastern Khost province, killing 10 civilians and three Afghan policemen and injuring six others on Saturday afternoon.
