  <text>Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood on Thursday voiced doubt the UN observer mission to Syria would come up with a solution to the violence in the strife-stricken country.
A seven-member advance team arrived in Damascus on Sunday to prepare for the observer mission agreed with international envoy Kofi Annan as part of his blueprint for ending 13 months of bloodshed, according to AFP.
“We once again feel disquieted about the mission of international observers and the non-objective results it might issue, [due to the conditions that] the despotic [Syrian] regime is pressing on the [international team] ” the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood said in an issued statement.
Nonetheless, the Islamist group extended its thankfulness to the “international community, [represented by UN Secretary General] Ban Ki-moon, [international envoy] Kofi Annan and their team for the efforts they are making to put an end to the [killing] targeting Syrian [people].” 
But the Islamist group expressed its reservations on the “executive measures that [were taken as part of] Annan’s initiative.” 
“Annan’s [failure to see] the ongoing shelling and killing [in Syria] and his silence over the [presence] of the heavy militarily vehicles [on the streets] left us disquieted. [Annan] also stopped calling, seriously, for releasing political prisoners,” the Muslim Brotherhood said.
The Islamist group added that if violence in Syria does not halt and if the UN observers are not chosen from “non-partisan countries… then unfortunately we will have to tell the international observers what we told [their Arab fellows]: Your mission does not concern us and our people will find their way [to obtain] their legitimate rights.”
Monitors say 11,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, while the United Nations puts the death toll at more than 9,000, according to AFP.
