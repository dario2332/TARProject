  <text>Meanwhile,French President Nicolas Sarkozy accused Syria leader Bashar al-Assad of wanting to “wipe Homs from the map,” comparing his campaign to the Libyan regime’s attacks on the rebel city of Benghazi.
Sarkozy also told Europe 1 radio Russia and China’s isolation on the Syria question “will not last” and that the two countries will eventually join the rest of the international community in backing action against Damascus.
On Wednesday, plainclothes Syrian security agents opened fire at anti-regime protesters near the cars of U.N. monitors in a Damascus suburb, a witness said. Amateur video showed people ducking for cover as gunshots rang out.
The videos could not be independently confirmed. But the Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian security forces fired at protesters in the suburb of Arbeen, wounding eight.
Wednesday’s shooting raised concern for the safety of the monitors. Under a plan brokered by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, six observers arrived in Syria over the weekend as an advance team for a larger contingent meant to shore up a week-old cease-fire that has been buckling under regime assaults on opposition strongholds and several bombings and shootings by the rebels. The truce was supposed to pave the way for talks between Assad and the opposition trying to topple him.
Annan’s spokesman, Ahmad Fazwi, confirmed that the U.N. observers were in Arbeen on Wednesday. He said it would be “appalling” if it was confirmed Syrian forces opened fire in the area.
Annan’s plan is seen as a last hope for reversing Syria’s slide toward civil war after a 13-month-old uprising to oust president Assad killed more than 9,000 people, according to the U.N.
Despite persistent violence, the international community is reluctant to declare the cease-fire dead, in part because it is seen as the only way to end bloodshed in Syria. Other options, such as foreign military intervention, arming Assad’s opponents and economic sanctions, have either been discarded or offer no quick solution. A deadlocked international community would be hard put to offer an alternative if it were to acknowledge the collapse of the truce.
