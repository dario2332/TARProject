  <text>UNITED NATIONS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday questioned whether the Syrian government troops were behind the Friday massacre in the Middle East country, with the UN-confirmed death toll rising to 108.
Deputy Russian permanent representative to the United Nations Alexander Pankin told reporters that Moscow was skeptical about suggestions that the Syrian government used such heavy weapons as tanks and artillery in the deadly attacks, in which more than 32 children under the age of 10 had been killed.
"We need to establish whether it was the Syrian authorities ... before we agree on something," Pankin told reporters before he entered the council chamber for the emergency meeting. "There are substantial grounds to believe that the majority of those who were killed were either slashed, cut by knives, or executed at point blank distance."
Pankin made the statement as he was heading toward the council chamber where an emergency meeting started at around 2:30 p.m. EST on Sunday to discuss the massacre.
"The number of those wounded does not correspond to what you would expect in terms of destruction," Pankin said. "You cannot have one or two houses destructed and 500 wounded with shrapnel."
Syria on Sunday denied the involvement of the government troops in the deadly carnage in the central village of Houla two days ago, blaming "hundreds of heavily armed gunmen" who also attacked soldiers in the area for the killings.
Britain and France had proposed issuing a press statement to condemn the attack, but Russia told the council that it disagreed the proposal and wanted a briefing first by the head of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS), General Robert Mood.
Mood told the council that UN observers at the scene now estimated that some 108 people were killed in Houla, Herve Ladsous, the UN under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, told reporters outside the council chamber. He said that the observers confirmed from examination of ordnance found on the spot that artillery and tank shells were fired.
Initial reports said that more than 90 people were killed in Houla, near the Syrian city of Homs, on Friday.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Kofi Annan, the joint special envoy of the UN and Arab League for Syria, condemned on Saturday "in the strongest possible terms the killing," which they described as "appalling and brutal crime" and that "those responsible for perpetrating this crime must be held to account."
