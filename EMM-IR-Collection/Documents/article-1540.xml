  <text>LONDON: Representatives from the Syrian opposition met Foreign Secretary William Hague for the first time in London on Monday although he said it was too early for Britain to formally recognize them.
Hague said Britain was determined to "increase the pressure on the Assad regime" over its bloody crackdown on opposition demonstrators.
"I discussed this with the Secretary-General of the Arab League yesterday, and I believe they will wish to do at their further meeting tomorrow," he added.
The behavior of the Syrian regime was "appalling and unacceptable", Hague said, and "we will do what we can to support democracy in Syria in the future".
However, he reiterated that Britain was not planning to take military action in Syria along the lines of the air campaign which supported the rebel advance in Libya.
"We are not contemplating or advocating military action in Syria in the style of what we did in Libya," he said.
