  <text>Regime forces fired on protesters who took to the streets of Aleppo on Friday, wounding several people at the biggest rally seen in Syria's second city since a revolt erupted last year, a watchdog said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said demonstrators also suffered gunshot wounds in Douma, a key protest hub near Damascus, but did not provide any casualty figures.
"Thousands of people demonstrated in various districts [of Aleppo] despite the repression," said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
"These are the most important events in Aleppo since the beginning of the revolt," he told AFP in Beirut.
The government said its forces foiled a suicide bomb attack in Aleppo last Friday, a day after twin bombings in Damascus killed 55 people and wounded nearly 400. It has repeatedly blamed such attacks on "terrorists.”
And growing suspicions of an Al-Qaeda presence in Syria have further complicated matters for the fragmented opposition, which has repeatedly refuted any links to the Islamist organization.
Besides Aleppo, protests demanding the ouster of Assad also took place in Damascus, Deir az-Zour in the east, northeastern Hasaka, Homs in central Syria, and northwestern Edleb, said the Britain-based Observatory.
They came after a call by activists for Syria-wide protests under the rallying cry, "heroes of Aleppo University", in solidarity with students in the northern city who demonstrated there the day before despite brutal repression.
On Thursday, the students were met with brutal repression by security forces, despite the presence of UN military observers, who now number more than 250 across the country out of the total of 300.
One protester was killed in a separate demonstration Thursday night in the Aleppo neighborhood of Salaheddine, according to the Observatory, while an officer was killed in a bomb explosion in the city on Friday.
Violence persisted elsewhere, with regime forces renewing their bombardment of Rastan in central Homs province on Friday, according to the Observatory—only a day after a blistering assault on the rebel stronghold.
Heavy gunfire and shelling was reported in several neighborhoods of Homs city, said the watchdog.
In Damascus province, heavy gunfire was reported near the town of Harasta, while the army suffered casualties in an attack on a military checkpoint at the town of Dariya.
