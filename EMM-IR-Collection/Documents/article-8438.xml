TEHRAN: Kofi Annan says the situation in Syria should be ''much improved'' by a deadline today if both sides in the conflict respect a peace plan he drew up.
The UN special envoy said the regime of the Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, has given ''further clarifications'' over how it would implement its side of the plan after it failed to observe a Tuesday deadline to withdraw its forces from urban areas.
He warned it would be ''disastrous'' if rebels fighting the Syrian regime were to be armed, as proposed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
''I've always said the militarisation of the conflict will be disastrous,'' Mr Annan said during a visit to Iran, Syria's chief ally in the Middle East.
Another ally, Russia, is under pressure to take stronger action against Syria. The US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, said Russia had made claims about wanting to avoid civil war and a regional conflict.
''But their refusal to join with us in some sort of constructive action is keeping Assad in power, well armed, able to ignore the demands of his own people, of his region and the world,'' Mrs Clinton said.
Russia has wielded its veto power on the UN Security Council to protect Syria from efforts by Western powers and their Arab allies to consider sanctions against Mr Assad's regime and call on him to step aside.
That stance may become more difficult to maintain after Russia got Mr Assad to agree to a troop pull-out by Tuesday, a pledge he didn't keep.
Mrs Clinton will meet her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Washington at a gathering of G8 foreign ministers. She said she expected ''a very rough couple of days in trying to determine whether we go to the Security Council seeking action knowing that Russia is still not on board''.
Even as Syrian rebels denied government claims it was pulling back troops under the terms of a ceasefire, on Tuesday the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told the Syrian authorities it was up to them to calm the border situation.
In Moscow, the Syrian Foreign Minister seemed to emphasise more preconditions for observing the ceasefire plan.
Walid al-Moallem was also quoted as accusing Turkey of arming rebel groups and permitting them to cross the border into Syria: an allegation that further increased tensions on the combustible frontier between the two countries.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group in Britain, said a village near Aleppo in the north had been shelled on Tuesday and that mortars had landed in the central city of Homs. Other places were relatively calm, the group said,  but there was no sign of large-scale withdrawals by government forces.
