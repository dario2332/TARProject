A UN-appointed panel of human rights experts has documented cases of unlawful killings, torture and abuses by Syrian government forces and anti-government groups, the group said.
The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said in a report that since March, Syrian government forces have killed people unlawfully during anti-government demonstrations in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo, Hama, Damascus and Dar'a, and in "numerous villages throughout the country".
The commission also said that armed anti-government groups have killed army and security forces and suspected informers they have captured.
