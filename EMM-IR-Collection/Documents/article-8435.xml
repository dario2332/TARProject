  <text>Syria will end military operations on Thursday, state TV has said, the day a ceasefire brokered by the UN-Arab League envoy to Syria is scheduled to come into effect.
Envoy Kofi Annan said the Syrian authorities had told him they would "cease all military fighting throughout Syrian territory" by 06:00 (03:00 GMT).
However, the violence continued on Wednesday, particularly in Homs.
Activists said at least 11 people had been killed across the country.
The Syrian government failed to withdraw its troops and weaponry from population centres on Tuesday as agreed under the Annan plan.
Mr Annan received a letter from the Syrian foreign ministry agreeing to cease fighting but reserving the right to respond "proportionately to any attacks carried out by armed terrorist groups against civilians, government forces or public and private property", his spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said.
Earlier, speaking on a visit to Iran, Mr Annan told reporters he had received "further clarifications" from the government of President Bashar al-Assad on how it intended to suspend hostilities.
"If everyone respects it, I think by six in the morning on Thursday we shall see improved conditions on the ground."
But he said the government was still seeking assurances that opposition forces would also stop the fighting "so that we could see cessation of all the violence".
He said the region "cannot afford another shock" and warned that any miscalculation or mistakes in Syria could have "unimaginable consequences".
Iran has been a key ally of Damascus, but Mr Salehi said that "as long as the peace plan continues its approach, Iran will support it".

The US permanent representative to the UN, Susan Rice, who is chairing the Security Council, said on Tuesday: "The Syrian leadership should now seize the opportunity to make a fundamental change of course."
1. Syrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people
2. UN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians
3. All parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting, and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause
4. Authorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons
5. Authorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists
6. Authorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully
The Syrian government initially agreed to the deal, but then on Sunday said it wanted written guarantees of a "halt to all violence" from all opposition and armed rebel groups, along with a promise from foreign states that they would not continue to support the rebels.
The FSA has also warned that it will resume attacks on government forces if they did not fully comply with the Annan plan.
On Wednesday, activists reported that the Khalidya district of the central city of Homs was again being shelled by government forces.
Troops backed by tanks also carried out a series of raids in the southern city of Deraa and several surrounding towns.
"The army is exploiting the ceasefire to arrest more dissidents than ever, and security forces are burning houses," activist Omar al-Hariri told the Reuters news agency, adding that he had never seen so many troops.
Restrictions on reporting in Syria mean such reports are impossible to independently verify.
Meanwhile, Turkish media reported that shots fired by Syrian troops had hit a refugee camp just across the border. CNN-Turk television showed gunfire directed from a border post flying the Syrian flag.
Turkey is now hosting some 24,500 refugees from Syria, after the number rose steeply in the past week. There are also 10,000 refugees registered in Lebanon and 7,000 in Jordan.
The UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the uprising, which began more than a year ago. In February, the government put the death toll at 3,838 - 2,493 civilians and 1,345 security forces personnel.
