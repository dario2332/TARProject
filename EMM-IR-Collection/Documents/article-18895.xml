yrian activists say regime forces fired on a funeral procession in the presence of UN observers, causing many casualties.
The activists said the observers were not among the wounded today, but their vehicles were damaged.
A UN spokesman confirmed the observers were caught up in the country's violence on Tuesday and their cars sustained damage. But Ahmad
Fawzi, a spokesman for special envoy Kofi Annan, had no other details.
An Idlib-based activist, Fadi al-Yassin, said he witnessed the attack on the funeral and saw that the observers were there.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing a network of sources on the ground, also reported the attack.
