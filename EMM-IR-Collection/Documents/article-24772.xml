The fighting, which also wounded 18 people, erupted after reports emerged that army troops had shot dead an anti-Syria Sunni cleric when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in north Lebanon on Sunday.
The fighting in Beirut raised fears of a repeat of sectarian clashes in 2008 that pitted Sunnis against Shia and brought the country close to civil war.
The opposition has accused Assad of seeking to sow chaos in Lebanon in order to relieve the pressure on his regime.
More than 12,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have died in Syria since an anti-regime revolt broke out in March last year, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
