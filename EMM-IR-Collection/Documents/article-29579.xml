  <text>ISTANBUL: A suspected suicide bomber detonated explosives inside a car outside a police station in the central Turkish province of Kayseri on Friday, killing himself and a police officer and wounding some 20 others, Turkish media reported.
Kurdish separatists, Islamist militants, including Al-Qaeda, as well as groups on the far left and right have all carried out bomb attacks in Turkey, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Broadcaster NTV said the bomber had tried to drive his car into the police station moments before the blast took place. At least 19 people were wounded in the attack, six of them seriously, other media reported.
NTV said a second assailant was also involved. Reuters could not immediately confirm any of the details surrounding the attack which took place in the town of Pinarbasi east of Kayseri city. Kayseri province is located some 325 km (200 miles) southeast of the Turkish capital Ankara.
"We heard that it was a car which attempted to drive into the police station and then an explosion occurred."
Television footage showed frantic scenes around the police station in Pinarbasi with fire engines and ambulances rushing to the site of the blast.
