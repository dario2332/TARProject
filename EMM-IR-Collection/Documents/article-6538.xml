  <text>DAMASCUS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Clashes and anti-government protests reportedly erupted Friday in several Syrian cities calling for arming the rebel Free Syrian Army just days ahead of a UN deadline to end the violence in the conflict-stricken country.
Protests erupted in areas such as southern Daraa, northern Aleppo and central Hama provinces, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees (LCC).
Opposition activists also reported that troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad shelled Deir Baalba and Rastan areas in central Homs province Friday.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian government forces hit the town of Rastan in northern Homs with heavy machine guns and mortars when clashing with the Free Syrian Army.
The group also said that government forces clashed with armed rebels in the Damascus suburbs of Douma, Saqba and Arbeen, adding that three members of the military were killed.
Activists said army troops on Thursday entered Douma, a restive suburb about 12 km out of Damascus believed to have hideouts of the armed rebels.
The opposition's report could not be independently verified.
Friday's incidents came just one day after the UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement to support the April 10 deadline for ceasefire on the part of the Syrian government to bring an early end to the year-long crisis in the country.
Kofi Annan, the UN and Arab League joint special envoy for Syria, said Thursday that "a cessation of violence is an important beginning" in bringing peace to Syria, calling on both the Syrian government and opposition to observe the timelines to end fighting.
Meanwhile, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Ja' afari, told a press conference at the UN headquarters in New York Thursday that the Syrian government is committed to the six-point peace plan proposed by Annan and supported by the UN Security Council, adding that Annan is being updated on a daily basis by the Syrian Foreign Ministry on the peace plan.
Annan's six-point plan calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons and troops from populated areas, a daily halt of fighting for the delivery of humanitarian aid and treatment of the wounded, and talks between the government and opposition.
The Syrian government has accepted Annan's six-point plan and the April 10 deadline to end fighting.
However, a top Syrian official said late Thursday that the UN Security Council's statement to support the deadline "will not encourage the implementation of Annan's mission," calling on Annan to obtain a written guarantees from the opposition to lay down weapons and halt its attacks on government troops.
The senior official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said the statement by the Security Council "targets Syria." The official said Syria had sent a written later to Annan in which it announced its commitment to withdrawing the military from cities and populated areas in the Damascus suburbs, the resort town of Zabadani, Homs and northern Idlib provinces by April 10.
"However we haven't received any commitment by the other side so far," the official said.
The deadline would pose a big challenge to Annan because the other part has not presented any commitment to curbing the attacks, said the official, making Syria's implementation to Annan's plan conditional to the written guarantee from other sides. "Syria is committed to implement Annan's mission so long as the other part shows commitment to halt attacks."
Meanwhile, opposition figures inside Syria welcomed the Security Council's statement and urged the Syrian authorities to implement Annan's plan.
Abdul-Aziz Khair, member of the opposition National Coordination Committees, told Xinhua that Annan's mission is "the last chance to spare Syria from drowning in more disastrous and tragic situations."
