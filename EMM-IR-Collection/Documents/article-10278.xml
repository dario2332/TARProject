Col. Philip Aguer said Saturday that villages near the disputed oil town of Heglig fell under heavy aerial bombardment and that he expected ground fighting to resume "anytime" soon.
Troops from South Sudan captured the oil-rich border town, which is claimed by Sudan, on Wednesday.
Aguer said southern forces did not plan to give up the town, which lies along the ill-defined border between the two Sudans.
"As we speak now, the SPLA is still in full control of Heglig," Aguer said, using the acronym for the southern army.
Call to armsLarge crowds of civilians turned up at the headquarters of Sudan's ruling National Congress Party on Saturday, answering a call by the government to help fight Southern Sudan. The call came after South Sudanese forces overran Heglig, an oil-producing town on the disputed border between Sudan and South Sudan, on Wednesday. Volunteers in civilian clothes offered to join the fight, while members of the People's Defence Forces in newly issued uniforms, brandished weapons.
Sudan's government accuses Southern Sudan of invading the oil rich region and has bombed the area in retaliation, according to South Sudanese officials. The UN has asked both sides to show restraint, but tensions continue to escalate, leading many to fear a return to all-out war.
