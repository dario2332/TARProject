  <text>First major challenge against regime since truce took effect on Thursday morning draws tens of thousands across country
Tens of thousands of Syrians  have taken to the streets for anti-government protests in the first major challenge to the country's 48-hours-old ceasefire, which for a second day witnessed isolated outbreaks of violence.
The demonstrations on Friday came as the UN security council prepared to approve the dispatch of the first group of monitors to Syria. They are expected to arrive in the country as early as next week.
An advance team of UN observers is poised to enter Syria if and when the security council gives the green light for its deployment, while a larger contingent of up to 250 observers could be approved next week if the truce holds.
France called for the creation of aid corridors to help Syrians escape "massacres", saying a UN-brokered ceasefire offered an opportunity to put the humanitarian measures in place.
President Bashar al-Assad's opponents had called for mass demonstrations to test whether the authorities would tolerate a return to peaceful protests, as the joint Arab League-UN envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan said they should.
But rallies videoed by activists were far smaller than the huge, chanting crowds seen in major cities at the start of the uprising 13 months ago and on several occasions in 2011.
International pressure has grown for Syria to fulfil all its commitments to the former UN chief by withdrawing troops and heavy weapons, permitting humanitarian and media access, releasing prisoners and discussing a political transition.
Instead, Syrian forces appeared to tighten security around public squares and outside mosques. According to activists whose accounts could not be independently verified, security forces used live fire, teargas and beat protesters to prevent them gathering in cities across the country. The same sources said that at least three protesters were shot dead by security forces during the day.
In the Damascus suburbs of Zabadani and Douma, and in the northern town of Idlib, large crowds linked arms and chanted anti-government slogans.
In the southern city of Deraa, birthplace of the uprising, several hundred people formed rows, holding hands and dancing to the beat of a drum while chanting, "Come on, Bashar, leave!"
The government claimed that opposition fighters had killed an officer in Hama, which would also represent a breach of the ceasefire.
However, there was no evidence of widespread shelling, sniper attacks or other potential violations of the ceasefire.
The reports of ceasefire violations – over 30, according to activists – came as Ahmad Fawzi, Annan's spokesman, said that scattered reports of violence in Syria did not mean the ceasefire was failing, and called on both sides to exercise restraint.
"With every cessation of hostilities there will be skirmishes. This is not unusual, sometimes the parties test each other," he said, adding, "The most important thing is that the guns remain silent."
"Wherever their positions, we hope they should and will remain silent."
"There may continue to be skirmishes for hours or even days, but the fact of the matter remains that heavy shelling … has died down."
