  <text>CAIRO, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Arab League (AL) Nabil al-Arabi said Friday that he received a letter on Thursday from Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem in which Syria proposed modifications on the Arab observer mission.
Walid al-Moallem suggested modifications over the deal on the observer mission to Syria, said a statement issued by the AL, adding that the AL is studying the modifications suggested by the Syrian side.
The Arab League issued Wednesday in Rabat, Morocco, a draft deal on the Arab mission of 500 observers to Syria and gave the Syrian government three days to sign it after it suspended Syria's membership in the pan-Arab body.
Syria claimed the suspension was illegal, but said it still intended to implement the Arab peace plan which it accepted on Nov. 2 to end its eight-month-long protests. The violence in Syria has left more than 3,500 dead according to U.N. figures.
