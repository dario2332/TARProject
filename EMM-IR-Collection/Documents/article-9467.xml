  <text>The human rghts' group added that demonstrators hurled stones at security forces in the Tariq al-Sadd district of Daraa, south of Damascus, cradle of the protest movement that erupted in March last year.
After the ceasefire came into force at dawn Thursday, peace envoy Kofi Annan declared he was “encouraged by reports that the situation in Syria is relatively calm and that the cessation of hostilities appears to be holding.”
But as Assad’s government and the rebels traded accusations of trying to wreck the ceasefire, Annan insisted “all parties have obligations to implement fully the six-point plan.”
The SNC, the most widely recognized opposition group in exile, and Internet-based activists called for peaceful demonstrations across Syria to test the government’s readiness to accept public shows of dissent.
“We call on the people to demonstrate and express themselves... The right to demonstrate is a principal point of the plan,” Burhan Ghalioun, head of the Syrian National Council, told AFP.
But Syria’s interior ministry insists people wanting to demonstrate must have permits.
“The right to demonstrate peacefully is guaranteed by law. We call on citizens to apply the law by requesting a permit before demonstrating,” said a statement carried by the official SANA news agency.
Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad fought rebels on Friday near the border with Turkey, according to activists in the first clash since a U.N.-brokered ceasefire came into effect a day earlier.
The clash appears to be the first serious violation of an internationally brokered ceasefire that went into effect a day earlier.
