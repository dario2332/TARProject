An advanced party of six United Nations observers will begin monitoring the Syrian ceasefire today.
24 others are expected to arrive in the coming days.
Monitors say Syrian forces have killed two civilians and are locked in fierce clashes with rebels in one city while bombarding opposition bastions in another, hours after UN observers arrived.
Five civilians were killed yesterday in shelling of the city of Homs and the UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan has described the ceasefire as being "very precarious".
Mr Assad has halted shelling of rebel-held neighbourhoods, with the exception of Homs, but ignored calls to pull troops out of urban centres, apparently for fear of losing control over a country his family has ruled for four decades.
Rebel fighters have also kept up attacks, including shooting ambushes.
Reports from Syria cannot be independently verified as state authorities have barred international journalists and rights groups.
The international community hopes UN observers will be able to stabilize the cease-fire, which formally took effect Thursday.
A six-member advance team of UN observers headed to Damascus on Sunday, a day after an unanimous UN Security Council approved such a mission.
A larger team of 250 observers requires more negotiations between the U.N. and the Syrian government next week.
"It is important - absolutely important that the Syrian government should take all the measures to keep this cessation of violence," he told reporters in Brussels after meeting Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo on Sunday. "I urge again in the strongest possible terms that this cessation of violence must be kept."
Mr Ban said he had in-depth discussions Saturday with Annan in Geneva and expressed hope that once the full monitoring team is on the ground "there will be calm and stability and peace without any violence."
