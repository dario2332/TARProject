  <text>The UN-Arab League peace envoy and Damascus have signed an agreement on the conditions of an expanded observer mission for Syria. At the same time, the UN chief warned that Syria hadn't fully complied with the truce.
Diplomatic efforts to end the violence in Syria continued on Thursday with the foreign ministers from the group of 14 Western and Arab countries known as the “Friends of Syria” gathering in Paris. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council was meeting in New York to discuss expanding a monitoring mission to the country.
The two meetings came just hours after Damascus and the UN-Arab League peace envoy for Syria, Kofi Annan, announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of the observer mission.
"This preliminary agreement… aims to facilitate the task of the observers within the framework of Syrian sovereignty," a statement released by the Syrian Foreign Ministry said.
A statement from Kofi Annan's spokesman said the agreement outlined "the functions of the observers as they fulfil their mandate in Syria and the tasks and responsibilities of the Syrian government."
The spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Annan's team was holding "similar discussions" with members of the opposition, both armed and civilian groups.
Despite this agreement signed on Thursday, there was a dispute brewing about how big the observer mission should be.
More observers needed
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used a letter to the Security Council to call for it to approve an expanded mission of 300 observers for an initial three-month period. He argued that 250 weren't sufficient to monitor the fragile cease-fire. So far the Security Council has approved a mission of just 30 monitors.
At the same time, though, the secretary-general noted that Syria had so far failed to fully comply with the terms of the cease-fire agreement brokered by Annan. This has led some Security Council members to express doubts about whether they could support an expanded mission.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, on the other hand, indicated that Damascus may not be prepared to accept the higher figure, describing 250 as a "reasonable number."
Lavrov stays away from Paris
In Paris, meanwhile, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia, an ally of the Syrian regime, was notable by his absence, but speaking to reporters in Brussels he said Moscow was "honestly fulfilling it part to end the violence."
The host of the talks, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, said he expected the meeting to send "a message of firmness and support for Kofi Annan."
In Syria itself, the violence continued despite the truce. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least three people killed on Thursday. Such figures cannot be independently verified due to a lack of access to the country by foreign journalists.
