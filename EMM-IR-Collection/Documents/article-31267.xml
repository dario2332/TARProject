The Syrian government insists it was not responsible for the massacre of at least 92 people in the central town of Houla which has sparked an international outcry.
"We completely deny responsibility for this terrorist massacre against our people," foreign ministry spokesman Jihad al-Makdissi told a news conference on Sunday.
He blamed "terrorists" for the massacre on Friday and Saturday.
The government had opened investigation, he added.
"We have set up a military and legal committee to investigate," he said. "The results will emerge within days."
Al-Makdissi said UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan would arrive in Syria on Monday for fresh talks with senior officials.
The United Nations has been leading calls for urgent international action on Syria after the massacre, which included dozens of children.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan jointly condemned the "appalling and brutal crime," which involved "indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force," and was "a flagrant violation" of international law and commitments by Syria's government not to use heavy weapons or violence.
"Those responsible for perpetrating this crime must be held to account," the UN chief and Annan added.
The UN mission said 92 bodies, 32 of them children aged less than 10, had been counted in the central Syrian town of Houla after reports of an artillery bombardment by President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
Friday's offensive resulted in one of the bloodiest episodes since his regime launched a brutal crackdown on opponents in March last year that has left thousands dead.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the deaths an "atrocity" and said Washington would work with the international community to heap pressure on "Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end."
"Those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account," she said in a statement.
Britain said it was in urgent talks with allied countries on "a strong international response" while France said it was making plans to host a Friends of Syria meeting in the wake of the latest deadly violence.
The head of the UN observers in Syria, Robert Mood, described the Houla killings as a "brutal tragedy."
The rebel opposition Free Syrian Army (FSA) called on the UN to meet its responsibilities and stop the violence in Syria. Otherwise, it said, the group could no longer commit to the ceasefire brokered by Annan.
Annan earlier this year brokered a six-point peace plan, which included a ceasefire that went into effect on April 12. The ceasefire has been breached on several occasions since it was reached.
Video footage posted on YouTube showed the bodies of dead children in Houla with shrapnel wounds on a floor. The sound of wailing could be heard.
State television aired some of the footage posted by activists on their websites, saying the bodies of victims were massacred by "terrorist" gangs.
The government has frequently blamed "armed terrorist groups," backed by Arab and foreign powers, for the violence.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr described the violence as a "crime that cannot be tolerated" and called for an immediate investigation to determine those responsible for it.
The opposition Syrian National Council, which groups exile opposition figures, urged the UN and the Arab League to convene emergency meetings to discuss the alleged massacre.
In a statement, Arab League head Nabil Al-Arabi called the killing in Houla a "horrific crime" and urged the UN Security Council to "stop the escalation of killing and violence by armed gangs and government military forces."
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said many people left Houla after the reported massacre, which sparked protests in the northern city of Aleppo.
The Observatory said one person was killed and 10 wounded in the northern town of Saraqeb, where government forces opened fire on protesters.
