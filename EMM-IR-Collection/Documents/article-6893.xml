ANKARA, April 10, 2012 (AFP) - Relations between Turkey and Syria, which share a long border, have soured since a widespread revolt broke out against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad early last year.
Large numbers of Syrians begin flocking across the border to escape the violence.
By mid-month Turkey says it is sheltering 8,000 Syrians, many of whom are housed in tent cities just over the border.
August 9: Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu visits Damascus and calls on Assad to end the repression.
September 21: Erdogan meets with US President Barack Obama in New York. The Turkish leader says his country has broken off its contacts with the Syrian regime and is planning to enact sanctions against it.
October 2: Syrian opposition leaders meeting in the Turkish city of Istanbul announce the creation of a broad-based Syrian National Council.
October 4: The Turkish news agency Anatolia says Colonel Riyadh al-Asaad, who defected from Syria's army in July, has set up a Free Syrian Army operating out of Turkey.
November 13: Pro-regime protesters in Syria attack Turkish diplomatic missions.
November 30: Turkey says it is cutting trade relations with Syria.
March 15, 2012: A Turkish official says Syria has laid landmines along the common border to prevent its citizens fleeing. The next day, Turkey advises its nationals to leave Syria.
March 26: Turkey closes its embassy in Damascus.
April 1: Istanbul hosts a meeting of the "Friends of Syria", an informal grouping of mainly Western and Arab states.
April 9: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, says Syrian forces have fired across the border into Turkey at camps housing refugees from the violence.
April 10: Former UN chief Kofi Annan, who is mediating in the crisis, arrives in Turkey to visit refugees.
Meanwhile violence continues despite a looming ceasefire deadline set by a UN-Arab League plan to which the Assad regime has assented.
The number of Syrians who have taken refuge in Turkey is now estimated at 25,000. According to UN figures, the crackdown on dissent in Syria has left more than 9,000 dead since it started in March 2011.
