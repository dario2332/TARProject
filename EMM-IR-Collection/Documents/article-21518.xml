  <text>Travyon Martin, the unarmed teenager killed by George Zimmerman in Florida, reportedly had injuries to his knuckles when he died.
The claims in US media emerged after a post-mortem examination and could support Zimmerman's allegations that Trayvon attacked him before the 28-year-old shot him dead.
The medical examiner found two injuries on the 17-year-old's body: the fatal gunshot wound and broken skin on his knuckles, according to WFTV.
Neighbourhood watch volunteer Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder and is now awaiting trial after being released on bail last month.
Legal expert Bill Sheaffer said the reported post-mortem findings were better for the defence than the prosecution.
He said: "It goes along with Zimmerman's story that he acted in self-defence, because he was getting beaten up by Trayvon Martin."
But Mr Sheaffer warned there could be another explanation for Trayvon's knuckle injuries.
"It could be consistent with Trayvon either trying to get away or defend himself," he told WFTV.
Meanwhile, a medical report detailing injuries Zimmerman allegedly suffered in a struggle with Trayvon has apparently emerged.
The report from Zimmerman's family doctor the day after the killing claimed he suffered a "closed fracture" of his nose, two black eyes, two lacerations to the back of his head and a minor back injury.
Also, the FBI is looking into charging him with a hate crime after state prosecutors said Zimmerman profiled and stalked Trayvon before killing him, according to WFTV.
If convicted of a federal hate crime involving murder, he could face the death penalty.
Zimmerman, who was patrolling his neighbourhood in Stanford, claimed the black teenager confronted him, broke his nose and knocked him to the ground, slamming his head on the pavement.
The defendant, who has a white father and a mother from Peru, said Trayvon threw the first punch and he opened fire in self-defence in the February 26 incident.
The killing sparked national uproar in America, but police initially refused to arrest Zimmerman, saying he was protected by a controversial state law that allows individuals to use lethal force to defend themselves if they feel threatened.

This whole case is pathetic, when two white British men were shot dead not long ago by a black man, the story was not broadcast even a quarter as much as this story. The whole thing is riding the racism train. Notice how every story relating to this case has to mention that he's a "black teenager" and has "a white father".
