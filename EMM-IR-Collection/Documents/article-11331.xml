  <text>In his first response to the attacks, Karzai praised the performance of the Afghan security forces.
He said they had proved themselves capable of defending their country.
Officials say 36 gunmen and eight members of the security forces died in the attacks on the Afghan capital and several provinces.
On Sunday, militants attacked the district in central Kabul where many embassies are located, as well as the parliament building. The clashes in the city ended on Monday, 18 hours after they began.
Insurgents also carried out attacks in Nangarhar, Logar and Paktia provinces. The Taliban say they carried out the raids as part of a co-ordinated "spring offensive".
