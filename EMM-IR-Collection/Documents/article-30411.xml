More than 90 people have been killed across Syria as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and tanks were deployed in the country's second largest city, Aleppo.
More than 50 civilians, including 13 children, were killed in army shelling of Houla, a town in the central province of Homs.
"Many people are fleeing Taldu village in Houla," the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, adding that residents feared new attacks on the town.
Reports from Syria cannot be independently verified as state authorities have barred international journalists and rights groups.
The violence came as the UN-Arab League envoy to Syria Kofi Annan finalised plans to return to Damascus early next week.
Meanwhile, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has said the Syrian groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad now control significent parts of some cities.
In a document addressed to the UN Security Council, Mr Ban said UN efforts to end the conflict in Syria had seen only small progress.
Mr Ban also said that the size and sophistication of some recent bomb attacks in Syria suggest that "established terrorist groups" may have been behind them. He urged states not to supply arms to government or rebel forces.
"The overall situation in Syria remains extremely serious and there has been only small progress on some issues," the document said.
"There is a continuing crisis on the ground, characterised by regular violence, deteriorating humanitarian conditions, human rights violations and continued political confrontation," he said in the letter, which was obtained by Reuters.
Mr Annan will visit Syria soon to discuss the lack of significant progress in implementing his six-point peace plan.
