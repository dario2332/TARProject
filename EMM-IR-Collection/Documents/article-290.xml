  <text>The WikiLeaks revelations have already caused immense embarrassment to William Hague but his pains count as the most trivial of setbacks compared to the epic calamity inflicted on pro-Western officials in Lebanon.

The Foreign Secretary had been accused of pandering to the US ahead of last May�s general election since his private conversations with state department officials became public.
The accounts of conversations with members of Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri�s government have revealed collusion with the state�s main enemy.
Elias Murr, the defence minister has been caught red-handed conspiring with the United States of America to facilitate an Israeli invasion in 2008.
The Wikileaks cables reveal how, over a two and a half hour lunch with American diplomats, Mr Murr spelt out areas that Israeli jets should hit.
He also revealed he had ordered the Lebanese army 'not to get involved in any fighting and to fulfil a civil defence role�.
The minister�s only concern was that the invading force refrain from attacking Christian areas. Attacks on Shia Muslims was 'Hizbollah�s problem� and Mr Murr - a Christian in a Sunni-led government - hoped that the offensive would allow the army to displace the radical Iranian-backed group that is Lebanon�s strongest force.
His plan was for the Lebanese army to remain in its bases � then take over once Hizbollah�s militia forces had been defeated.
The Americans concluded that Murr 'seems intent on ensuring the Army stays out of the way so what Hizbollah bears the full weight of an Israeli offensive.�
Almost as damaging, Murr�s testimony directly implicates the Lebanese president Michel Sleiman. In March 2008, at the time of the conversation, the Lebanese president was army chief of staff. And Murr told his American friends that he had already instructed Sleiman that the Lebanese army should not get involved 'when Israel comes.�
It has been commonly claimed that the Julian Assange�s Wikileaks revelations have contained no dazzling revelations. But these revelations are bound to inflict long term damage on the already troubled government of Prime Minister Hariri.
It is true that local reaction in Beirut has been measured, even from Hizbollah, and that Elias Murr himself has reacted with amazing insouciance.In a statement he called for Lebanese who have labelled him a traitor to be put on trial. He asked: 'Who will try those who are accusing other Lebanese of treason only because they hold a different opinion?�
But this muted reaction is only because the Lebanon is already facing what threatens to become the country�s greatest crisis since the end of the civil war twenty years ago.
A United Nations investigation into the 2005 assasination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri (father of the current premier) is set to issue draft indictments that are widely expected that the tribunal to identify Hizbollah as the perpetrators of the crime.
Sources say the indictment will go to the judge within days.
When the charges are published many believe Lebanon will face a dangerous conflagration. 
Hizbollah was yesterday mounting a last ditch attempt to discredit the tribunal, warning that it will cause 'chaos.�
Ammar Mousawi, Hizbollah�s director of international relations, issued a steely warning to me at its headquarters in southern Beirut. He said: �We view the tribunal as an aggression against us. We will deal with this aggression with means and methods that are required.�
A finding against Hizbollah would license Sunnis to mount revenge attacks on Shias and could trigger all out fighting. The tribunal has been viewed as flawed by Hizbollah from the start.
He said: 'I want to underline a point. Our position against the indictment is not a position against justice or truth. At the dialogue table all parties including us were concerned with punishing the perpetrators. We still adopt the same position.
�But in any offence or criminal act the investigators start by looking at the list of those who have benefitted. But there was no motive for Hizbollah. We and the Syrians were the people who were most disadvantaged by the killing of Hariri.�
The Israelis, suggested Mousawi, were more likely the guilty party. 
The danger of a return to violence has stimulated a desperate last minute campaign by Saudi Arabia and Syria to stop the tribunal in its tracks.
This would involve Prime Minister Saad Hariri withdrawing his support for the tribunal. As the son of the murdered man, Harriri�s acquiesence carry�s huge weight in the Arab world.
Deals like these may sound unsavoury- and contrary to natural justice- but in Beirut it may avert diaster. 
The government is already in paralysis because of the tribunal - the cabinet has not met for the last three weeks because of the dispute.
Beirut has seen a return to peace and even prosperity after the desperate decades of internal strife. Cafes and restaurants are full amidst an unprecedented construction boom which has seen many of the loveliest parts of the old historic city replaced by towering blocks of flats.
But this week, the question I was most often asked by tremulous waiters, cab-drivers and hotel staff was: 'Are we about to return to civil war?�
