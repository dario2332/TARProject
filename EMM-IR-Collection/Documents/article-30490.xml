  <text>High alert: Police officers stand guard on a street after the man opened fire around 2am this morning
Dead: The gunman also shot dead an 18-year-old man and critically wounded a 23-year-old female police officer responding to the emergency call
Copy cat? The incident comes less than a year after right wing gunman Anders Breivik killed 77 people in a rampage in neighbouring Norway
The incident follows a series of shooting sprees in Finland in recent years and comes less than a year after anti-immigrant gunman Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a rampage in neighbouring Norway.  
Shootings are not uncommon in Finland where there are 650,000 officially recognised gun owners in a population of 5.4 million people, with strong hunting traditions.
In recent years, Finland also has seen two deadly school shootings.
In 2008, a culinary student killed nine fellow students and a teacher before shooting himself at a vocational school in the western town of Kauhajoki.
A year earlier, an 18-year-old killed six fellow students, a nurse and the principal at a high school in Tuusula, southern Finland.
Two months ago, a 23-year-old gunman wounded the father of his former girlfriend in an office building before firing several shots through a classroom door in southern Finland.
No one was hurt at the junior high school, and the attacker quickly surrendered.
