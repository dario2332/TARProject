  <text>Meanwhile, twenty-three Syrian soldiers were killed in the town of Rastan on Monday in heavy clashes with rebels who destroyed three armored personnel carriers, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Earlier, opposition sources said a local rebel commander was among scores killed in heavy army shelling of Rastan, Reuters reported. 
“Shells and rockets have been hitting the town since three a.m. (midnight GMT) at a rate of one a minute. Rastan has been destroyed,” a Free Syrian Army (FSA) member in the town who declined to be named told Reuters by satellite phone.
The town, 25 km (15 miles) north of the city of Homs, is a major recruiting ground for Sunni conscripts who provide most of manpower in the military, which is dominated by officers from Assad’s minority Alawite sect.
The area was scene of the first serious armed confrontations between army defectors and loyalist forces last year. Assad’s forces regained control of the city several times but it has kept slipping back into rebel hands.
The town lies about 180 km (110 miles) north of Damascus, among farmland and wheat fields on the Orontes River and on the northern highway leading to Aleppo.
Its strategic location and the terrain has helped deserters from disparate units mount raids against army buses and roadblocks manned by Military Intelligence and pro-Assad militia, opposition activists said.
In Lebanon, two people were killed and 20 others were wounded in the northern city of Tripoli in fresh sectarian clashes linked to the unrest in neighboring Syria, a security official told AFP.
He said the victim died in the neighborhood of Jabal Mohsen, populated mainly by members of Assad’s Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
Battles first erupted on Saturday between residents of Jabal Mohsen and the nearby neighborhood of Bab al-Tebbaneh -- populated mainly by Sunni Muslims opposed to Assad’s regime -- after security forces arrested a Sunni Islamist on suspicion he was linked to a terrorist organization.
