  <text>Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Friday voiced gratitude to Future Movement leader MP Saad Hariri and to other officials for contributing to the release of Lebanese Shia pilgrims who were kidnapped in Syria’s Aleppo.
“We thank President Michel Sleiman, Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Future Movement leader Saad Hariri, who made efforts to release them,” Nasrallah said during a speech he held on the occasion of Liberation Day.
Nasrallah also voiced gratitude to Turkish President Abdallah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He also said that Hezbollah was in contact with the Syrian leadership and authorities “who took care of the women and elderly [who were released shortly after their abduction] and helped send them to Lebanon.”
Nasrallah also said that the kidnap harmed the image of the assailants.
According to the National News Agency thirteen Lebanese Shia Muslims were kidnapped in Aleppo province on Tuesday as they were heading back home by bus from a pilgrimage in Iran. Their families said that they were abducted by Syrian rebels. The Free Syrian Army, however, denied the accusation.
The group was released on Friday and arrived in Turkey, AFP quoted Lebanese Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil as saying.
Nasrallah also commented on the killing of Sunni cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed in North Lebanon’s Akkar.
“The accident that happened in Akkar and led to the death of Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed is sad and we condemn it, but it was just an accident,” he said.
He also said that the Lebanese army must not be attacked or criticized over the incident.
On Sunday, army troops shot dead Abdel Wahed when his convoy allegedly failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria.
His death sparked tension in many Lebanese areas where protesters blocked roads using burning tires. In Beirut, two people were killed overnight Sunday in street battles in Tariq al-Jedideh.
Nasrallah also said that Hezbollah accepted to engage in national dialogue without imposing conditions, and called on March 14 parties to accept dialogue “if they really cared for the country.”
