  <text>Horrified Hillary Clinton said Bashar Assad's "rule by murder and fear" must end after dozens of children were massacred in one of the Syrian regime's deadliest attacks in the country's 14-month-old uprising.
The US secretary of state's condemnation came after gruesome video showed rows of dead Syrian children lying in a mosque in bloody shorts and T-shirts with gaping head wounds.
The shelling attack on Houla, a group of villages north west of the central city of Homs, killed more than 90 people, including at least 32 children under 10, the head of the United Nations observer team in Syria said.
The attacks sparked outrage from US and other world leaders, and large protests in the suburbs of Syria's capital of Damascus and its largest city, Aleppo. It also renewed fears of the relevance of a month-old international peace plan that has not stopped the almost-daily violence.
Mrs Clinton demanded that "those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account".
"The United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end," she said on Saturday night.
The UN denounced the attacks in a statement that appeared to hold President Assad's regime responsible and the White House called the violence acts of "unspeakable and inhuman brutality".
"This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centres and violence in all its forms," said UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon and international envoy Kofi Annan. "Those responsible for perpetrating this crime must be held to account."
Activists from Houla said regime forces peppered the area with mortars after large demonstrations against the regime on Friday. That evening, they said, pro-regime fighters known as shabiha stormed the villages, gunning down men in the streets and stabbing women and children in their homes. The Syrian government blamed the killings on "armed terrorist groups" - a term it often uses for the opposition - but provided no details or death toll.
UN observers, among more than 250 dispatched in recent weeks to salvage the ceasefire plan, found spent artillery tank shells at the site and UN officials confirmed they were fired at residential areas. The head of the team, Maj Gen Robert Mood, called the attack a "brutal tragedy".
