  <text>Change and Reform bloc MP Ibrahim Kanaan said on Sunday that those who want the truth behind the incident in which Sheikh Ahmad Abdel Wahed was killed should wait for the investigation’s results.
“He who wants to know the truth should wait for the investigation, place all his trust in the military institution and not politicize [the issue],” Kanaan told OTV.
“Those targeting the army are targeting [Lebanon’s], institutions and the country’s unity,” he added.
The MP also offered his condolences to the families of Abdel Wahed and his bodyguard.
Army troops shot dead Sunni cleric Abdel Wahed on Sunday when his convoy failed to stop at a checkpoint in North Lebanon, the scene of deadly clashes linked to the uprising in Syria, a security official said according to AFP. The sheikh’s bodyguard, Mohammad Hussein Merheb, was also killed.-NOW Lebanon
