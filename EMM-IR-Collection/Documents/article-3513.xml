  <text>Two Western journalists were killed on Wednesday as Syrian regime forces pounded the rebel city of Homs for a 19th straight day, activists said, while calls mounted for a truce to allow in humanitarian aid.
The latest barrage came a day after security forces killed at least 68 people across Syria, bringing the overall death toll of violence since March 2011 to 7,636 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The toll includes 5,542 civilians, 1,692 soldiers and police, and 400 rebel fighters, the head of the Britain-based rights monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman, told AFP.
Activist Omar Shaker from inside Baba Amr told AFP that two Western journalists were killed and three others wounded as a shell crashed into a makeshift media center set up by anti-regime militants.
The area remained the target of random shelling, blocking attempts to remove the bodies, the activist said.
France said one of the journalists killed was a French national, as the Syrian Observatory said the two journalists killed were an American woman, identified as Marie Colvin, and a French man named Remi Ochlik.Despite a plea by activists to allow women and children to flee Homs's besieged Baba Amr neighborhood, more troops were sent Tuesday to the outskirts of the restive city, monitors and activists said.
A call by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) for a two-hour truce daily to deliver aid to afflicted areas gained support from the United Nations, as well as from the United States and Russia.
The call came a day after the ICRC said it was in talks with Syrian authorities and rebels to halt the violence.
Syria's main opposition group, meanwhile, demanded the international community create "safe havens" in the country and called on Russia to force the regime to allow access for humanitarian convoys.
Moscow, a staunch ally of the Syrian-regime, on Wednesday also supported the ICRC call for a truce, expressing "serious concern" about the humanitarian situation, according to foreign ministry spokesperson Alexander Lukashevich.
Russia announced that it will not take part in the meeting because it was being convened "for the purpose of supporting one side against another in an internal conflict," the foreign ministry said.
China, meanwhile, refused to commit to attend the meeting.
The Friends of Syria group will meet for the first time after being created in response to a joint veto by China and Russia of a UN Security Council resolution condemning the bloody crackdown.
