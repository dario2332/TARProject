  <text>Several people have been shot dead during protests in Syria, activists say, as the UN considers deploying monitors to oversee a peace plan.
Security forces fired into the air to disperse crowds in several locations. But in some, protesters were shot dead.
Mr Annan wants the UN Security Council to approve plans to send observers.
There are detainees that need to be released, humanitarian corridors need to be opened"
Vitaly Churkin told reporters that Moscow wanted a very brief text for an advance team of up to 30 monitors to set the process in motion, giving the Security Council time to set out the full mandate for a bigger mission.
But, Mr Churkin said, the draft was much more detailed then Russia had expected, and therefore needed more negotiation. He called for a return to the "original idea" of a simple text.
In Syria, anti-government demonstrators poured out of mosques after Friday prayers in many areas, amid tight security precautions.
Activists said security forces fired into the air in many places to prevent or disperse protests. But in others, protesters were killed by gunfire.
Two people were killed as demonstrators attempted to reach the main square in the central city of Hama, they added.
"We tried our best to reach Assi Square in order to show the world the truth about the regime - they are lying and will not allow us to have big, peaceful demonstrations," Mousab Hamadee, an activist in Hama, told the BBC.
"As we approached Assi Square, they started opening fire on us. Two of my colleagues were martyred," he added.
Two other people were shot dead after Friday prayers in the town of Nawa, in the southern province of Deraa, while a fifth died in the town of Salqin, in the north-western province of Idlib, activists said.
The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an activist network, said security forces had killed 11 people across the country, including three in Deraa and two each in Hama, Idlib and Aleppo, it added.
1. Syrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people
2. UN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians
3. All parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting, and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause
4. Authorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons
5. Authorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists
6. Authorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully
The state news agency, Sana, said an army officer had been killed and 24 others injured when a bomb exploded next to a military bus in Aleppo, and that a Baath Party official had been shot dead in al-Mazarib, in Deraa province.
But the impression so far is that the violence does not seem to have been as bad as many had feared, given the fact that opposition leaders were calling for a massive turnout, and troops were already being accused of shooting at demonstrators the day before, our correspondent says.
With troops, tanks and heavy weaponry still deployed in and around population centres, the truce remains extremely precarious, he adds.
"There are detainees that need to be released, humanitarian corridors need to be opened," he told reporters.
Mr Fawzi said the advance team of 10 to 12 observers were "standing by to board planes and to get themselves on the ground as soon as possible". They could be followed by a larger mission of 250 observers, subject to UN Security Council approval.
The UN estimates that about 9,000 people have died since pro-democracy protests began in March 2011.
In February, the Syrian government put the death toll at 3,838 - 2,493 civilians and 1,345 security forces personnel.
