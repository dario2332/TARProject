  <text>The United Nations Security Council
authorized the deployment of observers to Syria to monitor a
cease-fire being tested by nationwide protests against President
Bashar al-Assad and reports of shelling by government forces in
The 15-member body voted unanimously today to pass a
resolution calling “upon the Syrian government to implement
visibly its commitments in their entirety” under a six-point
plan by UN special envoy Kofi Annan. An advance team of as many
as 30 unarmed military observers will go to Syria, followed by a
bigger mission if conditions allow it.
“Given that many considered the Annan plan dead on Monday
this is a significant step and puts a UN presence on the ground
not possible until now,” said George Lopez, a former UN
sanctions investigator now at the Kroc Institute for
International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame in
Indiana. “ As with other incremental steps, however, this is a
very thin team to monitor multiple city attacks.”
It is the first time the UN’s most powerful body has
succeeded in passing binding measures on Syria after Russia,
which has been allied with Assad’s regime, vetoed two draft
resolutions in October and February seeking to hold him
accountable. The council also “expresses its intention to
assess the implementation of this resolution and to consider
further steps as appropriate.”
While the cease-fire was largely holding after a truce took
hold on the morning of April 12, reports emerged of violence.
Syria’s army shelled three residential areas in Homs and a
village nearby, Al Arabiya reported, citing activists.
“We are under no illusions,”  U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice,
who holds the council’s presidency this month, told reporters.
‘Two days of diminished violence after a year of murderous
rampage hardly proves that the regime is serious about honoring
Syrian forces resumed their “brutal” shelling of Homs and
“shot innocent mourners at a funeral in Aleppo,” Rice told the
council. “This resumed violence casts serious doubt yet again”
on the regime’s promises, she said.
Homs, a flashpoint of the uprising seeking to topple
Assad’s rule, has been the target of a military campaign by the
regime, which says it’s fighting terrorists in the city.
Before the cease-fire, the death toll in Syria often
exceeded 100 a day, reaching 9,000 in the 13 months since the
start of the uprising, according to the UN. A prolonged lull
would allow deployment of unarmed monitors in the country, while
failure of the cease-fire may prompt calls for outside military
Russia has a stake in the survival of a Soviet-era ally,
selling the Assad regime weapons during the uprising. Still,
Moscow has leaned on the Syrian government to accept the cease-
fire terms and let UN monitors into the country.
“For many months now the situation in Syria has been the
subject of the fixed attention and alarm of the international
community and it’s understandable,” Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told the council after the vote. “There have been too
many casualties” and there are “too many destructive
consequences if the crisis continues to ratchet up.”
The U.S. has begun sending promised nonlethal aid to the
Syrian opposition, most of it medical and communications
equipment, according to an administration official who discussed
the shipments yesterday on condition of anonymity.
The supplies are going to nonviolent political groups based
on what they said would help them organize their efforts and
provide aid to civilians, and the aid is likely to increase, the
At least 1 million people in Syria “remain in need of
urgent humanitarian help,” the UN’s emergency relief
coordinator, Valerie Amos, said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. She said it’s “extremely important that negotiations
to enable humanitarian organizations in Syria to deliver aid
remain separate from other efforts to resolve the crisis.”
Assad, 46, is fighting for the survival of his Alawite
family’s four-decade hold on power. While more than 70 percent
of Syria’s population is Sunni, Assad and the ruling elite are
in a minority, belonging to an offshoot of the Shiite branch of
Islam that predominates in Iran and which stands to lose
privileges should he fall.
The UN has had monitors and political officers in the
Middle East since the 1940s as well as in other regions, the
most recent a group of 180 observers sent to oversee the end of
the civil war in Nepal.
A UN presence in Syria may involve 200 to 250 personnel
trying to cover a much larger country, according to Richard Gowan, associate director for crisis diplomacy and peace
operations at the New York University Center on International
“It will be very hard to establish a robust monitoring
presence in Syria if violent incidents continue,” Gowan said in
an e-mail. “UN planners will be concerned about keeping their
