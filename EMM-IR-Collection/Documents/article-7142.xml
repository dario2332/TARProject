INTERNATIONAL efforts to resolve the Syria crisis are in disarray,  with the regime of Bashar al-Assad failing to meet the deadline for the  withdrawal of troops who have killed more than 9000 civilians and  opposition soldiers since the country's uprising began just over a year  ago.
From Homs, Daraa and Idlib, Damascus to Aleppo, the list of the dead has  grown longer as Dr Assad's ferocious attack on his people escalated  with the approaching deadline - spilling over into neighbouring Turkey  and Lebanon.
As the deadline passed, China said it supported the proposals of United  Nations special envoy to Syria Kofi Annan for ending the violence.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said at a briefing yesterday in  Beijing that China hoped that the Syrian government and other parties  involved in a year-long conflict could commit to a peace plan crafted by  Mr Annan.
Russia yesterday called on Syria to implement the troop pullout.
''We demand from our Syrian colleagues to rigorously implement the Annan  plan,'' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said after talks in Moscow with  Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem. Mr Lavrov  said  Syria had not  been active enough in withdrawing its army units. Syrian opposition  groups must also accept an immediate ceasefire, Mr Lavrov said.
The border village of Salama, north of Aleppo, was raided by tanks amid  heavy machinegun fire targeting those trying to flee to Turkey, the  Syrian Network for Human Rights reported.
Syrian gunmen also fired at refugees crossing the border, and into the  Turkish refugee camp in Kilis, killing two Syrians and wounding 15  others, including Turkish staff at the camp.
The attack, which drew fierce condemnation from Turkey and from the UN  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, has raised fears that the Syrian conflict  might draw in other countries in the volatile region.
The camp is metres from the border and  home to about  8000 of the  24,000 refugees who have crossed into Turkey. Mr  Annan's team is  expected to visit the camp in coming days.
''Syrian citizens who took refuge in our country from the brutality of  the current regime in Syria are under Turkey's full protection,'' the  Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
''We will certainly take necessary measures if such incidents reoccur.''
In Lebanon, a cameraman was killed when Syrian forces fired across the  border into the Wadi Khaled area in the country's north. Lebanese  security officials said gunfire came from the nearby Syrian village of  Armouta.
It is no surprise that President Assad reneged on his agreement to  implement the Annan-negotiated peace plan, said Rami Khouri, the  director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and  International Affairs at the American University of Beirut.
