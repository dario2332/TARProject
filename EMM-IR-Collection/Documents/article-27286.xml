  <text>Lebanese Foreign Minister Adnan Mansour said Wednesday that a group of Lebanese Shiite Muslims kidnapped in Syria would be freed "within hours."
Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah earlier urged restraint after Tuesday's kidnappings sparked protests by thousands of people here.
"According to information provided by an Arab country those kidnapped will be free within hours," Mansour told al-Jadeed.
He identified the men behind the abductions as "a splinter group of the armed Syrian opposition," but did not give details.
The abductions of the pilgrims -- news reports put their number at between 11 and 13 -- were feared to further fuel sectarian tensions in Lebanon over the revolt in neighboring Syria.
They were kidnapped as they headed home to Lebanon from a pilgrimage in Iran and the news prompted their families and thousands of supporters to pour out into the streets of Beirut's mainly Shiite southern suburbs to demand their release.
Protesters blocked several roads, including the old airport road, with burning tires and garbage bins. The roads were reopened later in the evening.
The National News Agency said the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA), which is seeking the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's regime, had abducted 13 pilgrims in northern Aleppo province.
Syrian media said an "armed terrorist gang" had kidnapped 11 Lebanese and their Syrian driver.
Nasrallah, a strong ally of the embattled regime in Damascus, appealed for calm and said his party was doing its utmost to ensure the safe release of the men.
"I call on everyone to show restraint," Nasrallah said in a televised speech. "It is not acceptable for anyone to block roads or carry out violent acts."
Nasrallah said contacts were underway with Syrian authorities and other countries in the region for a quick resolution.
"We will work day and night until those beloved are back with us," he vowed.
Nasrallah said Hizbullah was also in contact with Prime Minister Najib Miqati.
"The Lebanese state and government have a responsibility to work toward the release of those kidnapped," he said.
Nasrallah urged his followers not to carry out revenge attacks against Syrians in Lebanon.
Syrian state media said the kidnapping took place near the town of Aazaz, which sits along the border with Turkey. It said the men were part of a group of 53 pilgrims on board two buses.
The women were allowed to go free and returned to Beirut by plane early Wednesday.
Among the pilgrims were 36 women, one of them said shortly after their arrival.
"After crossing the border between Turkey and Syria, we saw a white car pull up with men armed with Kalashnikovs inside," she said. "They told us they wanted to protect us from Syrian shelling. Then they handcuffed the men and lined them up against a wall."
Most women said the men presented themselves as belonging to the FSA.
"They terrorized us," said one of them.
Hizbullah MP Mohammed Raad, who was at the airport to welcome the women, said there were signs the matter would be settled "quickly."
Raad would not be drawn on whether rebels were behind the kidnapping when asked.
"We don't want to go into details of who is behind the abductions to make their release easier," he said. "We'll deal with that later."
Activists in Aleppo reached by Agence France Presse via Skype said Aazaz was undergoing fierce shelling Tuesday evening by regime forces who stormed the town.
The brother of one of those kidnapped said the FSA had vowed to release the men in exchange for rebels detained by Syrian authorities.
FSA spokesmen could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.
Miqati's office said he was making the necessary contacts to ensure the release of the men.
"Prime Minister Miqati has urged families of the kidnapped to remain calm and assured them he was following the issue closely to ensure the safety of those abducted and their quick release," a statement said.
The kidnapping took place amid heightened tension in Lebanon over the Syrian crisis.
Clashes between the pro- and anti-Assad camps in the country have left some 12 people dead in the past 10 days.
Nasrallah said it was necessary for all Lebanese to remain calm.
"The atmosphere is tense because of the events of recent days," he said. "Everyone is urged not to make matters worse."
Ex-premier Saad Hariri, who heads the anti-Assad opposition in Lebanon, denounced the kidnapping and called for the men's immediate release.
"We condemn the kidnapping of our Lebanese brothers in Syria, regardless of the party behind the kidnapping, and we call for their immediate release," he said in a statement.
An Al Qaeda operative gets arrested and Hariri’s Future Movement along with their fundamentalists almost start a war until he is released.
16 Shiyite pilgrims get kidnapped by the so called “Free Syrian Army” and Hassan Nasrallah tells the masses to stay in their homes and not disrupt the nation.
indeed, you have the hypocrites in suits and neckties behaving like a savage hordes, and then you have nasrallah, who has a different beard style, but demonstrates each time he speak how far ahead he is in terms of wisdom and civilization.

Min aymta Mansoor bemoon on the FSA lol !? it is all an act to counter what happened with the murder of the shiekh in akkar.
We have learned nothing from the past and other people's wars on our home land. Puppets to a sister country. A tyrant that trying to keep his clutches to power, over the bodies of the people, that he is supposedly their guardian. Lebanon has a resistance that has shown its true color on many occasions. Their arrogant ways, is the only righteous pious way. They have sent all their past achievements, aiding Lebanese to liberate the south from Israel, down the toilet. They became “Iran’s servants" in Lebanon.   A True viable resistance role is to be pointing their armory toward Israel, and not terrorizing Lebanese civilans.Especially those who may dare not see eye to eye with them always. Or is the Devil’s advocate covering up massacres in Syria. As well instigating unrest in Tripoli and spread it out all over when needed, to distract the world from his bloody clutches. History is to repeat itself, if allowed.
Syrian regime, has one policy, “To Anilities any one that gets in its way”. The Mask has fallen. “The Syrian tyrant regime has never been the defenders of any cause, in Palestine or anywhere in Lebanon”, but a self serving regime. The Brave Syrian people have chosen to no longer live under such Tyranny and are seeking real democratic change toward freedom. Lebanon is our only Permanent home land. Was set on fire numerous times, for other's Distractive Evil Agenda. Let’s protect LEBANON and keep it safe from all Evil wishers and Doers. Lebanese need to For once Shock the world and Unite despite the normal political differences. Please 8&amp;;14.work hand in hand ,together to save “Lebanon
blind sheep barking, funny specimens :)
If you had an ounce of dignity you would salute Nasrallah's words yesterday night, his immediate intervention and clear call for calm got everyone back home within minutes of his speech. 
When mawlawi got arrested, not even kidnapped, but arrested by official and legitimate Lebanese security services hariri called them "outlaws" and sided with mawlawi even before the judge had a chance to interrogate him. the weeks of clashes and dozens of dead resulted from that irresponsible and sectarian attitude. 
In front of that look at Nasrallah and the way he approaches things. you guys are so small in comparison. Long live Nasrallah and may you choke on your words of hatred :)
He stopped the demonstartions because he knew it was a Syrian plot
