IF the words of diplomats are to be trusted, Russia has blocked a United Nations (UN) Security Council statement on the massacre in Syria and has called for an urgent meeting of the council.
Britain and France proposed a statement condemning the massacre in the Syrian town of Houla where about 92 people – many of them children – were killed on Friday and Saturday.
But diplomats said Russia would not agree to the condemnation until a briefing was given by the head of the UN mission in Syria, Major General Robert Mood.
However, following the massacre, the United States (U.S.) has called for an end to President Bashar al-Assad’s “rule by murder”.
Also, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council this week.
Meanwhile, Syria’s foreign ministry denied army’s involvement, blaming “terrorists”. Its spokesman, Jihad Makdissi, said there was a clash in the area on Friday afternoon between security forces and armed terrorists.
He said hundreds of armed men then gathered, armed with heavy weapons including mortars and anti-tank weapons, and attacked Houla.
The government had sent a team to investigate the killings, he added.
However, activists said the Syrian military bombarded Houla after demonstrations. Activists added that some of the victims died by shelling, while others were summarily executed by the regime militia known as the “shabiha”.
The killings have sparked a chorus of international condemnation. Hague said he would lobby Russia, the regime’s only major foreign ally, during a visit to Moscow starting yesterday.
He wrote on his Twitter feed: “Will call on Russia to support rapid and unequivocal pressure on Assad regime and accountability for crimes.”
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it an “appalling” massacre, saying President Bashar al-Assad’s “rule by murder and fear must come to an end”.
In a statement on Saturday, Clinton called the deaths an “atrocity” and said Washington would increase pressure on “Assad and his cronies” to give up power.
France’s Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was making immediate arrangements for a Paris meeting of the Friends of Syria group.
The group includes Western and Arab nations, but not Russia or China, which have blocked previous attempts to introduce UN sanctions.
