  <text>The UN and Arab League international envoy Kofi Annan has been offered assurances by Damascus that the Syrian Government will adhere to the ceasefire agreement.
Kofi Annan said in Tehran earlier today that further escalation of the armed conflict in Syria would prove a disaster and result in unthinkable consequences.
Under the Annan peace plan, the Syrian government forces and the opposition are due to cease fire by April 12th.
On Tuesday, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Muallem, met his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow to confirm that Damascus is prepared to honour all of the plan's provisions, including the pull-out of troops from cities.
The Syrian Army has already left, in part, the city of Homs.
The G-8 Foreign Ministers are due to meet in Washington later today to take up the situation in Syria, among other things.
