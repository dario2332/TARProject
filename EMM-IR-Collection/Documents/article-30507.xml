Officers arrested the suspect near Hyvinkaa, some five hours after he fired 
  several shots from a low rooftop at people gathered outside a restaurant 
  just before 2am local time, said Detective Chief Inspector Markku Tuominen.
The suspect, a local man from Hyvinkaa, 30 miles north of the capital, 
  Helsinki, did not resist arrest, Tuominen said.
"The man was found with two weapons ... including a hunting rifle," Tuominen 
  said, adding that police knew of no possible motive pending an investigation.
The gunman killed an 18-year-old woman and an 18-year-old man, as well as 
  critically wounded a 23-year-old female police officer who arrived at the 
  scene soon after Hyvinkaa police received an alert.
Shootings are not uncommon in Finland where there are 650,000 officially 
  recognised gun owners in a population of 5.4 million people, with strong

In recent years, Finland also has seen two deadly school shootings.
In 2008, a culinary student killed nine fellow students and a teacher before 
  shooting himself at a vocational school in the western town of Kauhajoki. A 
  year earlier, an 18-year-old killed six fellow students, a nurse and the 
  principal at a high school in Tuusula, southern Finland.
After those deadly attacks, authorities took steps to improve safety at 
  schools, including installing surveillance cameras and locks on classroom 
  doors and training staff to deal with shootings.
Two months ago, a 23-year-old gunman wounded the father of his former 
  girlfriend in an office building before firing several shots through a 
  classroom door in southern Finland. No one was hurt at the junior high 
  school, and the attacker quickly surrendered.
