The Prime Minister said Bashar al-Assad's "deliberate flouting" of 
  the latest peace plan showed that further action was needed.
Former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan has secured commitments 
  from Damascus to pull its troops out of cities and halt all violence.
A ceasefire came into effect in the early hours of this morning, with reports 
  so far suggesting it is being observed. However, activists saw no sign that 
  Mr Assad was withdrawing his forces out of restive cities.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 during his South East Asia trade mission, Mr Cameron 
  said: "I feel an immense sense of frustration because the world has 
  come together behind this Kofi Annan plan.
"This is a plan, remember, that is not just backed by those of us who 
  have been pushing for action on Syria, it's also backed by China and Russia.

"And yet Assad is deliberately flouting it.
"Now is the time to say to the Russians and Chinese, look at the man we 
  are dealing with, look at the appalling way he is behaving.
"We need to go back to the UN and tighten the pressure, tighten the noose."
Syrian foreign minister Jihad Makdissi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that 
  Mr Assad's government had no intention of breaking the ceasefire and had 
  already made several military drawbacks.
Mr Makdissi said the Syrian government was prepared to enter a process to end 
  the conflict but said President Assad retained the support of a "majority" 
He said: "There is no reason to break the ceasefire at all.
"What is important is everybody should abide by the terms of calm. (Kofi 
  Annan) is asking cessation of violence by all parties, not only the Syrian 
"For our side we are fully committed for this. We have a clear mechanism 
  now in place, which is the Annan plan."
China's foreign ministry welcomed Syria's pledge for a ceasefire and called on 
  the opposition to honour the agreement.
"China welcomes the government's relevant decision, which will help to 
  ease tensions," the foreign ministry said in a statement on its 
  website. "China also calls on the Syrian armed opposition to 
  immediately cease fire and implement Annan's six-point proposal."
The flashpoint provinces of Homs, Hama and Idlib, which have been under 
  sustained shelling by government forces over the last week, were calm after 
  the 6am (0300 GMT) ceasefire deadline. An activist in Damascus said the 
  capital was also quiet.
"More than two hours have passed and it's completely quiet across the 
  country," said Rami Abdulrahman, director of the British-based Syrian 
  Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).
The Syrian government bars access to most independent media.
Fighting had raged in the countdown to Thursday's deadline, fuelling 
  widespread doubts that Syria would comply with the plan.
"It was a bloody night - there was heavy shelling on the city of Homs, 
  but now it is calm and there is no shooting," said an activist who 
  called himself Abu Rami, speaking from Syria's third largest city which has 
  endured some of the worst violence.
But, like activists in other towns, he said there was no indication that 
  Syrian army forces were withdrawing from Homs in accordance with the 
  ceasefire agreement. "There are no signs of a pull back - the tanks, 
  snipers and armed forces are still visible across the city," he said.
The Syrian Observatory reported explosions in Zabadani, a town close to the 
  Lebanese border, shortly after the deadline. But a resident contacted by 
  Reuters said the town was quiet.
