  <text>"You can only continue with tanks and guns to a certain point, the day will come when you will go," Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said during a speech at an international religion conference in Istanbul. "Sooner or later, the oppressed will win."
The attacks on the buses carrying Turkish citizens occured near the central Syrian city of Homs, where opposition to the regime is high.
One of the bus drivers, Erhan Surmeli, said he was taking 25 butchers back to Turkey from Saudi Arabia following the Muslim festival of Eid Al-Adha, or the feast of sacrifice.
"We had stopped at a checkpoint," Surmeli told The Associated Press by telephone from a Turkish hospital near the Syrian border. "Syrian soldiers emerged from behind sandbags and cursed Erdogan when we told them we were Turks. Then they suddenly opened fire at the bus."
The vehicle crossed into Turkey with at least one smashed window, video from the Turkish Dogan news agency showed.
"We came face to face with death," Ahmet Okkas, a passenger, said by telephone. "They shouted obscenities at us and opened fire."
Another Turkish citizen, Cemil Karli, was wounded in a separate attack on a second bus, the state-run Anadolu Agency said. That vehicle also crossed into Turkey and Karli was taken to a local hospital, it said.
"We were traveling in a convoy of eight or nine buses, first we were fired upon from a red car," the agency quoted Karli as saying. "Then others started firing at us."
"We were shocked. We piled onto each other in the aisle to save our lives," he said. "I was hit in the abdomen and in the leg."
On Sunday, the commander of a group of Syrian army defectors retracted earlier claims that his followers launched an unprecedented attack inside the capital, Damascus, in an embarrassing turnaround for the armed movement.
"We did not target the party building in Damascus and we will not target any civilian installation," said al-Asaad, who was wearing his military uniform.
There were no apparent damage or injuries.
Syria has banned most foreign journalists from entering Syria and prevented the media from moving freely in the country, making it nearly impossible to independently confirm events on the ground.
The Free Syrian Army, which claims to have more than 15,000 defectors in its ranks, is controversial among protesters involved in the uprising. Many in the opposition want the protesters to remain peaceful.
