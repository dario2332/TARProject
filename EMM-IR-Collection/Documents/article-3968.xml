A 43-year-old former student of a small Christian university in California has opened fire at the school, killing at least seven people and setting off a manhunt that ended with his capture at a nearby shopping centre, authorities in the US have said.
Police chief Howard Jordan said South Korean national One L Goh surrendered about an hour after the shooting at Oikos University, which serves the Korean community.
Mr Jordan initially reported that authorities recovered the weapon used during the rampage, but later clarified that police only recovered enough ballistics evidence to determine that a handgun was used.
"It's going to take us a few days to put the pieces together," Mr Jordan said. "We do not have a motive."
People connected to the school, including the founder and several students, described the gunman as a former nursing student at the university.
Police first received an emergency call reporting that a woman was on the ground bleeding. As more calls came in from the school, the first arriving officer found a victim suffering from a life-threatening gunshot wound.
It was an "extremely chaotic scene," Mr Jordan said. More officers arrived and formed a perimeter around the school on the belief that the suspect was still inside, he said.
Mr Jordan said potential victims remained inside the building trapped by a locked door which officers were unable to open. Others were unable to flee because they were injured, he said.
Jordan said there were about 35 people in or near the building when the shooting started. Of the seven fatalities, five people died at the scene and another two at hospital. The wounded victims were in stable condition, and at least one person was released from the hospital.
The suspect was detained at a Safeway supermarket about three miles from the university, about an hour after the shooting. Mr Jordan said Goh called his father soon after the shooting and told him what happened and his father called the police. The suspect's brother was killed in a car accident last year in Virginia while on active duty with the US Army, according to the Stars and Stripes newspaper.
