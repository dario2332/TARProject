Syrian troops have launched a fierce assault on a Damascus suburb.
The attack on Thursday on the suburb of Douma and other offensives around the country bolster the opposition's claim that President Bashar al-Assad's is intensifying violence in the days before a deadline to implement a ceasefire brokered by former UN chief Kofi Annan.
Activists say Assad wants to make gains on the ground before the truce is supposed to take effect on April 10.
Douma-based activist Mohammed Saeed reported that tanks were shelling residential areas "in one of the most violent campaigns against the area since the uprising started".
He said troops were using detainees as human shields as they marched into a square in the suburb, a few miles northwest of Damascus.
"Soldiers in the Ghanam Square near the vegetable market were walking behind detainees," Saeed said via Skype.
"They do that so that members of the Free Syrian Army do not open fire at the troops."
He said the shelling and clashes had been going on since 7am.
"The regime has no limits in its crimes. They are ready to do anything," said Saeed. "They are hitting homes directly."
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported one of the biggest operations of the uprising in Douma.
Amateur videos posted by activists showed black smoke billowing from residential areas as heavy cracks of gunfire sounded.
Douma, which has witnessed anti-Assad activities since the uprising began, has been subjected to several campaigns by Assad's regime over the past year.
The Observatory said troops were sending reinforcements into the suburb, where some residents are feared dead.
Rami-Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the regime appears to be "trying to put Douma under control once and for all". He added that hundreds of army defectors are believed to be in the suburb.
The Observatory for Human Rights said troops had clashed with army defectors in the northern towns of Hraytan and Anadan, near Syria's largest city of Aleppo.
The opposition is deeply sceptical that Assad will live up to his commitment to a truce and accuses him of buying time to continue his military crackdown.
The truce is the keystone of a plan put forward by Annan, in his role as joint UN-Arab League envoy, in an effort to end bloodshed that the UN says has claimed more than 9000 lives since March 2011.
The plan requires regime forces to withdraw from towns and cities, followed by a withdrawal by rebel fighters. Then all sides are supposed to hold talks on a political solution.
A Syrian government official claimed on Tuesday that troops had begun withdrawing from some calm cities while moving to the outskirts of tense areas. He gave no details.
Anti-regime activists deny troops are withdrawing and add that the latest assaults are evidence that Assad is trying to crush those seeking to overthrow his regime before the ceasefire begins. Activist groups reported more than 50 dead nationwide on Wednesday.
Mohammed Abu Nasr, an activist in Hraytan, said the town of about 50,000 had been subjected to intense shelling by tanks and helicopters since 5am local time. He added that a ground offensive began three hours later and hundreds of troops were pushing into the town.
"There are wounded people in the streets that we cannot reach because of the shelling," Abu Nasr said.
"The situation is catastrophic in the city. Large numbers of people are fleeing."
Hraytan is just north of Aleppo, which has been relatively quiet since Syria's uprising began in March 2011. However, towns and villages in the province have witnessed anti-government protests as well as defections among the army.
An amateur video posted online by activists showed smoke billowing from several areas in Anadan. The Observatory later reported that troops were trying to push through Anadan, adding that defectors had damaged three army vehicles and killed and wounded soldiers.
As the fighting raged in the north, more Syrians fled to neighbouring Turkey. Turkey's disaster management agency said more than 1600 refugees had arrived on Wednesday and Thursday. That pushes the total number of Syrians who have fled to Turkey to nearly 22,000.
