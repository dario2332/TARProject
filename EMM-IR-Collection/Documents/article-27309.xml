  <text>DAMASCUS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Syria confirmed the kidnapping of Lebanese Shiite pilgrims on its soil on Tuesday, a sign of escalation of the sectarian conflict in Syria.
Around 12 Lebanese pilgrims were kidnapped on Tuesday by the rebel Free Syrian Army in Azzaz, northern Aleppo province, while they were on their way back to Lebanon from Iran.
The latest incident widens the gap and exacerbates the sectarian conflict in Syria that has recently spilled over into neighboring Lebanon.
Many Shiite muslims have been kidnapped in Syria by armed rebels, who accuse Iran of sending its fighters to help the Syrian regime in stamping out the anti-regime movement in Syria.
Some observers believe that such incidents meant basically to drive wedges between the regional close allies - Syria, Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, thus weakening the ever increasing tide of Shiite influence in the region.
After the incident, Hizbollah chief Sayed Hassan Nasrallah urged restraint and called for reopening the roads which were blocked by family members of the abducted Lebanese Shiites in the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital Beirut.
"We do not want anyone to block roads. This harms people and obstructs people's life. It can also lead to other negative results amid the tense situation in the country," the chief stressed.
Nasrallah also said, "Some Lebanese people threatened to kidnap Syrians in Lebanon as a reaction, which is unacceptable."
In Syria, the army unleashed a wide-scale campaign in Azzaz in order to find the kidnapped Lebanese. Pro-government news websites said fierce clashes occurred in the region between government troops and gunmen, and that one of the abducted Lebanese has somehow escaped and is currently with the Syrian army.
The Syrian government has accused armed rebels of carrying out "terrorist" attacks to violate the cease-fire, while the opposition blamed the government for staging bomb attacks to tarnish the image of the anti-government movement.
It was reported that the rebel Free Syrian Army on Monday declared failure of the six-point peace plan brokered by UN/Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan, meaning that they would no longer abide by the plan that calls for a cease-fire and halt of violence from all sides.
On Tuesday, a group of UN observers have reportedly come under fire in the flashpoint city of Homs in central Syria, pro-government al-Ekbaria TV said, adding that one of the UN vehicles was damaged but no casualties were reported.
There has been no immediate confirmation from the UN mission in Syria. But if true, the attack would be the fifth that has targeted UN observers since their arrival last month.
One day earlier, UN Under-Secretary-General Herve Ladsous said the violence in Syria has not ceased "but clearly it diminishes," warning of the presence of terrorist groups in Syria, who are trying to capitalize on the current unrest to achieve certain gains.
An explosion ripped through al-Qaboun neighborhood of Damascus late Monday, killing five civilians and injuring several others. Several minor blasts across the country, mainly in the coastal Banyyas city and northern Aleppo.
Annan is set to visit Syria by the end of this month to follow up on the implementation of his plan, whose prospects are dim given the fact that the unrest in Syria has escalated into a sectarian conflict.
