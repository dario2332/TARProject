  <text>The opposition Syrian National Council has urged the UN Security Council to act urgently after claiming that regime forces massacred scores of civilians, including many children, in the town of Houla.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius condemned the massacre and said he was "making immediate arrangements for a Friends of Syria group meeting in Paris." He spoke after the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) again called for the Friends of Syria group of nations to carry out air strikes on the forces of President Bashar al-Assad.
Against that backdrop, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights accused the Arab and international communities of being "complicit" in the killing.
The Britain-based Observatory said the shelling had killed more than 90 people in Houla, including 25 children. Earlier, SNC spokesperson Basma Kodmani said "more than 110 people were killed [half of whom are children] by the Syrian regime's forces" in Houla.
On Saturday morning, people turned out to protest the killings, anti-regime activists said.
In Kfarnabel, in the northwestern province of Edleb, scores of men and women took to the streets to honor the dead, chanting: "We sacrifice our soul and life for you, O people of Houla," according to an amateur video posted on YouTube.
Protesters were also angry with the international community.
One demonstrator held up a sign reading: "[Kofi] Annan is singlehandedly responsible for the Houla massacre," blaming the special UN-Arab League envoy for continued violence.
Annan brokered a six-point peace plan, which included a ceasefire that went into effect on April 12 but has been breached daily since then.
More than 12,600 people have been killed in Syria since a revolt against President Bashar al-Assad's rule broke out in March 2011, including nearly 1,500 since a UN-backed truce took effect on April 12, according to the Observatory.
