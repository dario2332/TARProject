The US called for the vote after a second day of wrangling with Russia over security guarantees for the first 30 unarmed military monitors who UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan wants in Syria early next week.
Russia also opposed the council demanding that president Bashar al Assad carry out a promise to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from Syrian cities.
Russia's UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he was not "completely satisfied" with the talks held at the UN yesterday. Russia and China have vetoed two previous Security Council resolutions on Syria.
Meanwhile, forces loyal to Assad shelled the Jurat al Shayah and Al Qarabis districts of the city of Homs for around an hour today, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, without giving any immediate word on any casualties.
Further south, in the town of Dmeir, outside Damascus, security forces opened fire on a car, killing one civilian and wounding two, the Britain-based watchdog said.
Neither the United States nor its allies are certain that the UN resolution would escape a new veto.
"It would be wise not to make predictions," US ambassador Susan Rice said.
"There was a negotiation, there is not yet an agreement," France's UN Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters. "It's very tough, but there will be a vote tomorrow [Saturday] in any case."
"A veto cannot be ruled out," one Security Council diplomat said. "It would be catastrophic for Syria if it happens."
A new version of the resolution drafted by the US with Britain and France was sent to other council members late Friday for national governments to decide which way to vote.
Russia has also registered a shorter version of the draft for an eventual vote.
Both versions authorize the first 30 monitors in a force in Syria that would grow to more than 200 if the cease-fire started on Thursday holds.
The UN says more than 9000 people have been killed since an uprising against Assad started 13 months ago.
Mr Annan has asked for approval for the monitors and for the council to call for all six points of his peace plan to be carried out. The Syrian government has yet to pull troops and heavy weapons from protest cities.
