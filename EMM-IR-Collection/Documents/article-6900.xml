  <text>The shots fired from Syria at a Syrian refugee camp inside Turkey were a “clear violation” of the common border between the two countries, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday.
“It was a very clear violation of the border,” Erdogan told reporters in Beijing, where he is on an official visit. “Obviously we will take the necessary measures,” he was quoted as saying by the Turkish news agency Anatolia.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said: “These incidents are just another indication that the Assad regime does not seem at all willing to meet the commitments that it made to Kofi Annan.”
She derided Assad’s new condition for a truce as “chaff” to “stall for time” and said there was “no indication” of his forces preparing to withdraw.
Opposition activists in Idlib province, near the Turkish border, accused troops of mounting an offensive that had killed dozens this week, including young men rounded up and executed. Other anti-Assad groups said the army shelled a village near the central city of Hama, killing 30 people, including women and children.
“The world gave Assad a deadline,” said activist Mohammad Abdallah. “But he sees it as an opportunity.”
The United Nations says Syrian forces have killed 9,000 people in 13 months, while Assad’s government says rebels have killed more than 3,000 soldiers and security personnel.
Government curbs on the media limit independent reporting from inside Syria.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was “alarmed by the reports of continued violence and human rights violations in Syria, which resulted in an increased flow of refugees into neighboring countries,” his office said on Monday. “The timeline for the complete cessation of violence endorsed by the Security Council must be respected by all without condition.”
Failure to end the violence would turn attention back to the diplomatic stalemate that has left Western and Arab powers on the one hand and Assad’s friends in Russia, China and Iran on the other all calling for calm. But they are sharply at odds over how that might be achieved and how Syria would be governed from then on.
Kofi Annan will send a letter to the Security Council Tuesday on Syria, where a deadline for military to withdraw from urban areas has expired, his spokesman said.
“Mr. Annan will be sending a letter to the Council later today,” spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told AFP.
