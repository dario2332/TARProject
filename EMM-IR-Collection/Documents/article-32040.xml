  <text>William Hague has said there is an increasing risk of civil war in Syria and the government must implement an international plan to stop violence.
UN envoy Kofi Annan is due to hold talks with President Assad on Tuesday.
Mr Hague said the Annan plan was the "only hope" for stability in Syria.
He was speaking after holding talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, talks which were dominated by the violence of Syria.
The United Nations has condemned Syria for its use of heavy weaponry after at least 108 people were killed, including many children, in the Syrian town.
"I think we are all deeply disturbed by what we have seen over the weekend that has illuminated the continuing killing and abuse in Syria," he said.
Mr Hague said the Assad government must implement a six-point put forward by Mr Annan, a former UN secretary general, which would see an immediate end to violence and for a path towards a "more plural and democratic" system of government in the country.
"The Annan plan is the best hope for Syria, at the moment the only hope for Syria, to try and break the cycle of violence.
"It is not as if the alternatives in Syria are the Annan plan or the Assad regime retaking control of the country. The alternatives are the Annan plan or ever-increasing chaos in Syria and a descent closer and closer to all-out civil war and collapse.
"There needs to be a fundamental change in the approach of the Assad regime if Syria is to be saved from ever greater chaos and disorder."
Russia and China have blocked previous attempts to impose UN sanctions on Syria. Russia views Syria as an ally in the region.
"We are dealing with a situation in which both sides evidently had a hand in the deaths of innocent people," he said.
Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said: "We categorically deny the responsibility of government forces for the massacre."
Meanwhile, Syrian Olympic Committee chairman Mowaffak Joma has said the UK "has no right" to deny their athletes access to the London 2012 Olympic games.
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had said Syrian delegation members with connections to the regime will not be allowed entry.
Mr Joma said the Olympic charter forbids host countries from banning athletes.
The unrest in Syria has killed at least 10,000 people since protests against President Assad broke out in March 2011.
The brutal massacre in Houla, Syria, may shock the international community but it is unlikely to bring intervention any closer, argues Shashank Joshi.
