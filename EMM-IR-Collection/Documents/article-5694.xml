  <text>UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan expects both the Syrian government and the opposition to fully implement a ceasefire agreement by April 12, his spokesperson said on Thursday.
"What we expect on April 10 is that the Syrian government will have completed its withdrawal from populated centers ... and then we begin a 48-hour period during which there will be a complete cessation of all forms of violence by all parties," Ahmad Fawzi told reporters.
"So the clock starts ticking on the 10th on both sides to cease all forms of violence," he added.
The Syrian regime has told Annan that it has begun withdrawing troops from some parts of the country, said Fawzi, adding that the three cities cited were Daraa and Abadani in the southwest and Edleb in the northwest.
"We are in the process of verification," he said.
An advance team dispatched by Annan to pave the way for peacekeepers is also expected to arrive in Damascus today.
They will "begin discussing with the Syrian authorities the modalities of the eventual deployment of this UN supervision and monitoring mission" but will not be involved in verifying if troops have indeed begun withdrawing, said Fawzi.
The peacekeeping mission would be "ready to move in as soon as we have a Security Council resolution," he added.
Meanwhile, Annan will also travel on April 11 to Tehran, where he is to seek support from the Syrian ally for his peace plan.
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamanei has vowed to defend the Syrian regime and Tehran has provided President Bashar al-Assad's regime with political and material support in its brutal crackdown on a popular uprising that the UN estimates has left more than 9,000 people since mid-March last year.
Annan is due to address the UN General Assembly later Thursday about the situation in Syria.
The ex-UN chief, tapped as envoy in February, has previously briefed the UN Security Council twice on his mission in Syria.
He told the Security Council Monday that Assad had agreed to "immediately" start pulling troops out of protest cities and complete a troop and heavy weapons withdrawal by April 10.
However, violence across the country has left at least 170 people dead so far this week, according to activists.
