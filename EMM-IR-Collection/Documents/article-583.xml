  <text>Police and protesters have clashed for a second day in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, after the demonstrators reoccupied Tahrir Square.
Officers fired volleys of tear gas as they fought stone-throwing activists advancing on the interior ministry.
Two people were killed on Saturday in Cairo and Alexandria.
The violence in Cairo began early on Saturday when riot police tried to remove protesters who had spent the night in Tahrir Square following protests on Friday.
After clashes that lasted for much of the day and well into the following night, the police eventually pulled back into the surrounding streets, leaving thousands of protesters in control of the square.
A volunteer medic told me that many people have injuries from rubber bullets and buck shot, particularly to the eyes.
Clouds of stinging tear gas again fill the air.  Police are using it on nearby streets to drive back demonstrators trying to advance on the interior ministry.
Much of central Cairo is again closed off. Traffic is blocked and stores are shuttered up in what would usually be a busy shopping area. Some locals expressed anger at the disruption but a woman activist says the people must reoccupy the streets until there is a complete handover by the military to civilian rule.
A makeshift camp has sprung up in the square - exactly like the one that appeared during the protests in February that forced President Hosni Mubarak from power.
A temporary field hospital has been set up to treat injured protesters.
Protesters - mostly Islamists and young activists - have been holding demonstrations against a draft constitution that they say would allow the military to retain too much power after a new civilian government is elected.
They have repeatedly tried to gain a foothold in Tahrir Square again, but up to now they have always been removed quickly by the police.
"The violence yesterday showed us that Mubarak is still in power," one protester, Ahmed Hani, told the AP news agency.
"We have a single demand: The marshal must step down and be replaced by a civilian council," he said.
Health officials say as many as 900 people were injured, including at least 40 security personnel.
The demonstrators in Cairo set a government building and a police vehicle on fire and threw stones and petrol bombs at riot police.
The number of protesters grew during the day, reportedly after a call went out on social media for people to join the demonstration following the police assault.
Prime Minister Essam Sharaf called on the protesters to clear the square.
"What is happening in Tahrir is very dangerous and threatens the course of the nation and the revolution," a statement from the cabinet said.
One of the demonstrators, Ali Abdel Aziz, said security forces beat up protesters to break up the sit-in on Saturday.
Parliamentary elections are due to begin on 28 November and take three months.
Under those guidelines, the military would be exempted from civilian oversight, as would its budget.
This has angered protesters who fear the gains they have made during the uprising could yet slip away as the military tries to retain some grip on power.
