  <text>"This is terrorism... this is a heinous act, we are under threat 
but we will not be cowed," Odinga told reporters at the site of the blast in 
Nairobi's commercial heart.
Kenya has been hit by a wave of grenade attacks the police have 
repeatedly blamed on Somalia's Al-Qaeda linked Shebab insurgents or its 
Last month the hardline Shebab warned Kenya of revenge attacks 
for sending tanks and troops into Somalia in October.
The blast, which ripped through a small shopping complex on 
Nairobi's Moi Avenue in the early afternoon, left around 30 people wounded.
Witness blames bearded man
A witness wounded in a blast in downtown Nairobi says that the 
explosion occurred soon after a bearded man left a bag near her stall.
Irene Wachira spoke to The Associated Press from a Nairobi 
hospital bed on Monday. Wachira said the man came to the stall three times and 
acted as if he were interested in buying something. Wachira said the third time 
he came with a bag, he left it behind and then there was a blast.
Wachira described the man as "Arabic-looking" because of his 
relatively light skin. A doctor told AP that another person wounded in the blast 
said a Somali-looking man left behind the bag.
Minutes after the blast the pro-Shebab Twitter site Al-Kataib 
reported a "huge explosion in Nairobi" although did not specifically claim any 
"Kenya under attack? Of course the kuffar (unbelievers) has 
attacked Somalia!" read another Twitter message from the Kenyan-based Muslim 
Youth Centre, a group linked to the Shebab, according to United Nations 
The blast was powerful enough to rip the tin roof off the 
building and smash windows across the street.
Wounded were carried from the explosion in a commercial building 
housing several small shops. Many appeared to have cuts from broken glass or 
Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere had earlier said the explosion 
was not a grenade or bomb attack, and that "preliminary conclusions" suggested 
it was an electrical fault.
A large plume of black smoke rose high into the air as ambulances 
rushed the wounded to hospital, but fire fighting trucks with sirens blaring 
extinguished the blaze soon after.
"I addressed parliament and warned of such acts... we chased them 
from here now they are trying to come back," Odinga added.
"We'll remain united. Our security forces need to be 
strengthened," he added.
