  <text>BEIRUT - International mediator Kofi Annan will fly to Damascus on 
Monday for talks with the Syrian government, a Syrian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said, a day after the UN Security Council condemned the 
killing of 108 people in the town of Houla.
Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi confirmed in an email that Annan would
 hold talks with Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem on Monday 
ahead of talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad on Tuesday.
Annan brokered a ceasefire agreement last month which was aimed at 
stemming the violence in Syria after a year of protests against Assad 
and starting a process of political negotiations.
But hundreds of people have been reported killed since the truce was supposed to come into effect on April 12.
On Monday, an opposition group reported that the Syrian army's 
bombardment of the city of Hama has killed at least 41 people in the 
Syrian tanks and infantry fighting vehicles opened fire on several 
neighborhoods of Hama on Sunday after a series of attacks by rebel Free 
Syrian Army fighters on roadblocks and other positions manned by Assad's
 forces, opposition sources said.
