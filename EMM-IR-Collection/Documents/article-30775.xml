In one of the bloodiest incidents to date in the 15-month long uprising, 92 
  people were killed after a 12-hour regime assault on Houla, in the central 
Anti-government activists claimed that troops had first shelled several 
  villages and then sent in gangs of pro-regime thugs to "massacre" local 
  families in their houses.
Amateur videos released on YouTube showed footage of the mangled bodies of 14 
  child victims lying in rows in a makeshift morgue set up at a local mosque.
In one horrific scene, a man held up the limp corpse of a boy aged around 
  seven years old, a gaping hole where the child's nose and mouth should have 
  been. "This child, what did he do to deserve this?" he screamed.
Unarmed UN monitors, who had reportedly been prevented from visiting the area 
  on Friday because of the fighting, were reduced to documenting the attack's 
  horrific aftermath when they finally reached the scene on Saturday 
Will the Houla massacre prove a throw of the dice too far for the Assads?

Major General Robert Mood, the UN mission chief in Syria, said that of the 92 
  bodies his staff had counted in Houla, at least 32 were "under the age of 
  10". He described it as a "brutal tragedy".
The bloodshed, which began on Friday and was reported to have continued into 
  the small hours of Saturday morning, was amongst the worst single incidents 
  since the popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began 15 months 
  ago. It was also a severe blow to the credibility of the UN-backed peace 
  plan that was supposed to introduce a ceasefire in early April. Critics said 
  it was clear that the plan, backed by 250 UN monitors on the ground, was 
On Saturday the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, called for an urgent session 
  of the UN Security Council to discuss the killings, placing the blame 
  squarely on the Syrian government.
"There are credible and horrific reports that a large number of civilians have 
  been massacred at the hands of Syrian forces in the town of Houla, including 
"The Assad regime must ensure full and immediate access to Houla and other 
  conflict areas in Syria for the UN monitoring team, and cease all military 
However, the main Syrian rebel coalition, the Free Syrian Army (FSA), said it 
  was time for the international community to overcome its reluctance to get 
  directly involved in the conflict, and to carry out strikes on regime forces.
The Friends of Syria group, which includes the United States, France, Britain, 
  Germany and Saudi Arabia, has previously ruled out such action because of 
  the risk of getting embroiled in what many fear is already a low-level civil 
But General Mustafa Ahmed al-Sheikh, head of the Turkey-based FSA military 
  council, said regime opponents had lost all faith in the UN Security 
  Council, on which Damascus has Russia as a powerful backer.
"We are calling urgently on the Friends of Syria to create a military 
  alliance, outside of the UN Security Council, to carry out targeted strikes 
  against Assad's gangs and the symbols of his regime," Mr Sheikh said.
Houla, a loose collection of villages with a population of about 40,000, lies 
  on a plain around 25 miles north-west of the city of Homs, itself the 
  subject of a brutal siege by President Assad's forces in February.
The settlement is home mainly to members of Syria's Sunni Islam majority, but 
  borders areas dominated by President Assad's minority Alawite sect.
While eyewitness reports of Friday's violence were confused and often 
  contradictory, it followed an anti-government demonstration in Houla after 
  Friday's midday prayers. Some claimed that rebel gunmen had earlier courted 
  trouble by opening fire on checkpoints manned by government troops.
Whatever the spark, the scale of the ensuing attack appears to have been 
  brutal even the standards of the Assad regime.
Mousab Azzawi, of the Syrian Network of Human Rights, told The Sunday 
  Telegraph: "The operation started about midday, with the use of about 50 
  or 60 mortar shells. Then they started to use tanks and heavy artillery for 
  two hours. After that they deployed about 13 or 14 cars with mounted guns, 
  and raided houses at random. They took people out and started shooting 
In one household, he claimed, the gunmen slaughtered two entire families, 
  ranging from grandfathers to children.
"They did not kill them immediately by shooting. But they cut their throats 
  with knives. That is a very worrying signal, that the regime is trying the 
  maximum they can to push the people to a civil war."
One local eyewitness, who gave his name only as Mohammed, added: "At about 7pm 
  on Friday, a lot of Shabiha (pro-regime militiamen) came from three nearby 
  Alawite villages. They killed some kids by knife, some by gun and some by 
  suffocation. I saw with my eyes dozens of bodies of women and children."
In video footage shot in the local mosque, a shaking camera panned over the 
  children's corpses, which were laid shoulder to shoulder and included some 
  who looked under five years old.
In a corner, more corpses of men and women lay under patterned blankets, 
  including what was said to be one entire family. "We're being slaughtered 
  like sheep here," said one voice.
"Where are the UN observers?" pleaded another.
It was claimed that the majority of casualties had been inflicted at close 
  quarters, rather than by shelling.
Chaotic scenes followed when the group of UN observers finally arrived in 
"The people begged the observers to come with them to evacuate the bodies," 
  said Maysara Al-Hennawi, another resident. "They refused to help us and they 
  said that we should negotiate with the regime, and then they left."
Thousands of locals took advantage of the presence of the observers to flee 
  the area, he added, making their way through fields and rivers.
The Syrian government also broadcast footage of the casualties, blaming them 
  instead on "armed terrorist" groups which it said had also killed several 
  government troops. Damascus has long accused activist groups of exaggerating 
  and falsifying accounts to draw international attention to their plight, a 
  charge which independent observers say has sometimes been justified.
There seemed little doubt about the veracity of the video footage of the 
  corpses in the latest incident, though, which surfaced amid reports that 
  Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, was to visit Damascus this week 
  to try to patch up the ceasefire.
On Saturday, one demonstrator in Houla held up a sign reading: "Kofi Annan is 
  single-handedly responsible for the Houla massacre."
The scale of the task facing Mr Annan was spelt out in a report leaked on 
  Friday from the current UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, which conceded 
  that rebel groups now controlled "significant" parts of some Syrian cities 
  and that there was "considerable physical destruction" across the country.
"There is a continuing crisis on the ground, characterised by regular 
  violence, deteriorating humanitarian conditions, human rights violations and 
  continued political confrontation," said the report, which is to be debated 
  by the Security Council this week.
More than 12,600 people are now estimated to have died in Syria in the revolt 
  against Mr Assad's rule, including nearly 1,500 since the UN-backed truce 
  officially come into effect, according to the Observatory for Human Rights.
In a sign that the regime's grip on the country was slipping further, tanks 
  were deployed by the government for the first time this weekend in Aleppo, 
  Syria's second largest city. The city, a key commercial hub, had previously 
  been considered a pro-regime bastion, but saw large street protests on 
While neither side in the struggle is really seen to have properly observed 
  the ceasefire, the Free Syrian Army on Saturday warned that unless there was 
  an immediate halt to regime violence, it would abandon any commitment to it 
"We announce that unless the UN Security Council takes urgent steps for the 
  protection of civilians, Annan's plan is going to go to hell," a statement 
The group's calls for foreign military intervention are currently opposed at 
  the highest level. Only last week, however, the UN explicitly urged foreign 
  states not to supply arms to either the government or rebel forces.
"Those who may contemplate supporting any side with weapons, military training 
  or other military assistance, must reconsider such options to enable a 
  sustained cessation of violence," UN secretary-general Mr Ban told the 
  Security Council in a letter on Friday.
