The Syrian army’s pursuit of rebels across the Turkish border has shed light on claims of rebel groups using refugee camps as safe havens. Reports suggest the Free Syrian Army could be treating them as springboards to launch incursions into Syria.
Damascus says it has started pulling troops from cities to meet deadlines set by UN envoy Kofi Annan. But as the Syrian opposition claims bloodshed is continuing, Annan has been forced to defend his ceasefire plan insisting it's “still on the table.”
Thousands of people have taken into the streets of Damascus in a massive pro-government rally. Syrian President Assad, meanwhile, has sent a message to the UN blaming the opposition for the recent spate of violence ahead of the ceasefire deadline.
The actions of Friends of Syria group of states jeopardize realization of the UN peace plan for Syria, undermining international efforts to end violence in the country, Russian FM Sergey Lavrov said.
Damascus has agreed to an April 10 deadline to partially implement UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan’s peace plan, the former UN secretary general told the Security Council.

The announcement comes as the UN and Arab League envoy to Syria, Kofi Annan, says he has received assurances from Damascus that it will respect his ceasefire plan.
The Syrian government says it will "remain on alert  to confront any assault by armed groups against civilians and the  security and armed forces" after all military operation are halted by Thursday morning, reports Reuters citing the Syrian state  television.
"After our armed forces carried out  successful missions in combating  the criminal acts of terrorist groups  and imposed the authority of the  state on its land, (it has been)  decided to end operations starting  tomorrow morning," reads the aired statement.
A similar pledge has been made to the international envoy Kofi Annan.
"I have received government assurances they will respect the ceasefire. If everyone respects it I think by 6 in the morning on Thursday we shall see improved conditions on the ground," Annan said as quoted by Reuters.
Damascus has also confirmed the ceasefire to the Russian Foreign Ministry, reports Interfax news agency.
The Syrinan authorities still want a guarantee from the Syrian opposition that they are going to keep the truce, said Kofi Annan.
On Tuesday, the Free Syrian Army, one of the largest opposition groups fighting the regime forces, said it would respect Annan's plan, but vowed to continue their struggle if Damascus breaks the ceasefire.
The Middle East "cannot afford another shock," insists Kofi Annan. Any miscalculation or mistake in Syria could have unimaginable consequences, he says.
Annan was speaking after his meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, during which he appealed for Tehran's support. Iran is one of Syria's strongest allies. Salehi replied that Syria should be allowed change "under the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad."
Tuesday reports from Syria suggest the regime failed to withdraw its troops and weaponry from cities as it had agreed.
On Wednesday, opposition activists claimed the forces loyal to Assad were still shelling residential areas across the country. Residents of the western city Rastan in Homs province tell Reuters they are under attack. A fresh eyewitness video claims to show tanks entering the neighborhood of Homs, the cradle of the Syrian uprising.
