  <text>Syrian forces Wednesday shelled restive provinces across the country, reported opposition activists, as chances for a United Nations-sponsored plan to end the violence dimmed, dpa reported.
"Early morning shelling targeted Rastan and Al Khalidiyeh, two neighbourhoods in the central province of Homs, while shells rained down on the outskirts of the province of Hama," Omar Homsi, a Syrian activist in the area, told dpa.
At dawn in the capital, Damascus, Syrian troops started to storm the area of Kfar Sousa, a seat of several embassies and Syrian security buildings, said activists.
"The troops are massing in an area where overnight protests were held. They are searching houses on a hunt for insurgents," Haytham Abdallah, a Syrian activist, told dpa.
Syrian rebels on Tuesday gave the government a 48-hour ultimatum to stop bombarding dissident areas or else face intensified attacks.
The ceasefire is part of a peace plan proposed by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, who started Wednesday talks in Iran, Syria's main regional ally, to drum up support for his efforts.
Under Annan's plan, the government of President Bashar al-Assad had agreed to begin withdrawing forces from residential areas Tuesday morning and for a ceasefire to follow within 48 hours.
The opposition has said that the government has pulled no troops.
Iran has supported Syria since a pro-democracy uprising started in March 2011, which has claimed more than 9,000 lives, according to the UN.
