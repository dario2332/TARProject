  <text>WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- Two people were dead after a shooting at the Blacksburg, VA. campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech).
The two casualties include a police officer. The school didn't confirm whether the other was a student.
The shooting occurred at a routine campus traffic stop. According to the school, shortly after 12 p.m. local time, a school police officer stopped a vehicle on campus in the Coliseum parking lot near McComas Hall.
During the traffic stop, the officer was shot and killed.
Witnesses reported to police the shooter fled on foot heading toward the Cage, a parking lot nearby. At that parking lot, a second person was found dead.
Several law enforcement agencies have responded to assist. Virginia State police has been requested to take lead in the investigation. The school is in lockdown, and all transit services have been suspended.
The status of the shooter is unknown. The school advised the campus community to shelter in place and asked visitors not to come to campus.
According to the school, the suspect is described as white male, wearing gray sweat pants, a gray hat with neon green brim, maroon hoodie and a backpack. He was last seen on foot towards the direction of McComas Hall.
Seung-Hui Cho, a student of Virginia Tech, on April 16, 2007, killed 32 people before taking his own life. It was the worst school shooting in U.S. history.
