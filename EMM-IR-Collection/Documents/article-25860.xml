A 5.6-magnitude earthquake has struck Bulgaria's capital Sofia, shaking apartment buildings, rattling windows and causing residents to rush into the streets.
Initial reports suggest the quake, which occurred at 3.:00am (local time) on Tuesday, caused no casualties or damage.
The US Geological Survey says the earthquake was centred about 24 kilometres west of Sofia and occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 9.4 kilometres.
The USGS had initially reported the magnitude as 5.8.
Many people in the Bulgarian capital fled their homes and gathered in the streets.
"I've never experienced anything like this," said Ivanka Georgieva, who lives on the eighth floor in a residential block.
"It was very strong and it was frightening."
The quake was felt across the south-western part of Bulgaria.
The small Black Sea country of fewer than 8 million people lies in Europe's earthquake-prone Balkan region.
The quake comes on the heels of Sunday's 6.0-magnitude earthquake around the northern Italian city of Ferrara that killed six people and reduced homes and historic buildings to rubble.
