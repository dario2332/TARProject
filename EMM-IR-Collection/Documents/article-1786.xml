  <text>AP - Syrian activists say a surge in violence in the flashpoint city of Homs has killed dozens of people.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cited witnesses as saying 34 bodies were dumped Monday night in Homs.
Homs-based activist Mohammed Saleh says those killed were abducted earlier in the day in a spate of kidnappings and killings.
The reports could not be independently confirmed. Syria has banned most foreign journalists and prevents the work of independent media.
For nearly nine months, the government has been trying to crush an uprising against President Bashar Assad. But there are growing signs of an armed insurgency and mounting sectarian tensions that could push the country toward civil war.
