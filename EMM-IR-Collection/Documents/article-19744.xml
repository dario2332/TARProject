  <text>Three people, including a young girl, were killed Wednesday when Syrian government forces shelled a camp for displaced residents, opposition activists said.
The camp in Daraa is for displaced Syrians from the Golan Heights, who were not fleeing violence from the current unrest in Syria, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The three are among at least six people killed across the Syria on Wednesday, opposition activists said.
The latest report of terror comes a day after a four-vehicle U.N. convoy was struck by an explosive device in northwest Syria, the United Nations said.
No U.N. personnel were injured, but three vehicles were damaged, said Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for U.N.-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan.
