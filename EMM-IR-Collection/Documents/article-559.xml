  <text>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — More than 1,000 university students are blocking a main highway in eastern Afghanistan in protest against a proposed agreement to keep thousands of U.S. troops in Afghanistan past 2014.
An Associated Press photographer at the scene saw protesters in Jalalabad city block the road to Kabul on Sunday. They shouted "Death to America! Death to Karzai!" They said they would not accept any partnership with the United States. The protest comes a day after a council of elders endorsed the idea of such an agreement, though with conditions to protect Afghan sovereignty.
The Taliban condemned the meeting of elders on Sunday, saying that they were puppets of the Afghan government and therefore the NATO and U.S. forces it sees as occupiers.
