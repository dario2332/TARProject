  <text>KABUL: A suicide bomber on a motorcycle killed at least 10 people and wounded 26 on Wednesday in a northern Afghan province, officials and police said.
Lal Mohammad Ahmad Zai, a police spokesman for northern Afghanistan, said the bomber blew himself up in Maimanah, the capital of Faryab province. It was not clear what the target was.
Zai said of the 10 people killed, four were police officers and the rest were civilians - including two women and two children.
Earlier, NATO said two of its service members were also killed in a bomb explosion on Wednesday in northern Afghanistan. It provided no other details about the attack or the nationalities of the two. It was unclear if the two incidents were related. So far this year, 96 NATO service members have been killed in Afghanistan, including at least 52 Americans.
The director of Maimanah hospital, Abdul Ali Aleen, said six of the dead and the 26 wounded in the suicide bombing were brought to his hospital.
Abdul Satar Barez, deputy governor of Faryab, said the attack occurred near a park in downtown Maimanah about an hour and-a-half before noon.
