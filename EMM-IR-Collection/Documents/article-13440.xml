  forces battled militants for more than two hours after they attempted to 
  storm the Green Village complex east of Kabul early on Wednesday morning.
The attack began with a suicide car bomb at the compound entrance and 
  continued when fighters disguised in burqas tried to force their way in 
  through the damaged gate.
Gen Ayub Salangi, Kabul police chief, said four civilians in a passing car 
  were killed, a Nepalese guard on the gate and a student on his way to class.

A spokesman for the Taliban movement claimed responsibility for the attack on 
  a "military base", saying Mr Obama was "not welcome" in Afghanistan.
The high security Green Village compound, around three miles east of the city 
  centre on the Jalalabad Road, provides housing for hundreds of contractors 
  and foreign officials.
Reports said the attackers had failed to breach the inner defences, but had 
  managed to take an outer laundry building before they were surrounded and 
  killed by Afghan special forces and their Norwegian counterparts.
