  <text>The Syrian regime is not bound by a deadline to withdraw its troops from strife-torn areas, pro-government daily Al-Watan on Thursday quoted a government official as saying.
"There is no set date or deadline," the unnamed official said.
"April 10 is the date set for the beginning, not the end, of the withdrawal of troops and it does not constitute a deadline."
The United Nations had announced earlier this week that Damascus agreed to complete the withdrawal of regime forces from populated centers by April 10, in accordance with a peace plan brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan.
But activists on the ground and monitors say the regime of President Bashar al-Assad was clearly not honoring the accord given the continued troop deployments and violence across the country.
The official quoted by Al-Watan said the Syrian foreign ministry had linked the troop withdrawal to a commitment by rebels to also honor Annan's six-point peace plan, aimed at ending one year of violence that has left more than 9,000 people dead, according to the United Nations.
Annan's spokesperson said on Thursday that the former UN chief expects both the Syrian government and the opposition to fully implement the ceasefire agreement by April 12.
"What we expect on April 10 is that the Syrian government will have completed its withdrawal from populated centers... and then we begin a 48-hour period during which there will be a complete cessation of all forms of violence by all parties," Ahmad Fawzi told reporters in Geneva.
"So the clock starts ticking on the 10th on both sides to cease all forms of violence," he added.
The Syrian regime has told Annan that it has begun withdrawing troops from some parts of the country, said Fawzi, adding that "we are in the process of verification."
An advance team dispatched by Annan to pave the way for peacekeepers is expected to arrive in Damascus on Thursday.
They will "begin discussing with the Syrian authorities the modalities of the eventual deployment of this UN supervision and monitoring mission," said Fawzi.
