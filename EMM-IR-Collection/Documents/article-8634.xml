David Cameron has urged Russia and China to join the world in "tightening the noose" around the Syrian regime after a key deadline passed.
David Cameron has urged Russia and China to join the world in "tightening the noose" around the Syrian regime after a key deadline passed.The Prime Minister said Bashar Assad's "deliberate flouting" of the latest peace plan showed that further action was needed.Former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan has secured commitments from Damascus to pull its troops out of cities and halt all violence.But an initial deadline passed on Tuesday without the regime honouring its pledge to withdraw. A ceasefire came into effect in the early hours of Thursday, with reports so far suggesting it is being observed.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 during his South East Asia trade mission, Mr Cameron said: "I feel an immense sense of frustration because the world has come together behind this Kofi Annan plan."This is a plan, remember, that is not just backed by those of us who have been pushing for action on Syria, it's also backed by China and Russia. And yet, Assad is deliberately flouting it. Now is the time to say to the Russians and Chinese, look at the man we are dealing with, look at the appalling way he is behaving."We need to go back to the UN and tighten the pressure, tighten the noose."Syrian foreign minister Jihad Makdissi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Assad's government had no intention of breaking the ceasefire and had already made several military drawbacks.Mr Makdissi said the Syrian government was prepared to enter a process to end the conflict but said President Assad retained the support of a "majority" of Syrians.He said: "There is no reason to break the ceasefire at all. What is important is everybody should abide by the terms of calm. (Kofi Annan) is asking cessation of violence by all parties, not only the Syrian government. For our side we are fully committed for this."
