  <text>Dibidani Market in Bamako, Mali, on Thursday.
West Africa's regional trade bloc began drawing up plans for military action to tackle the twin crises of a coup and a rebellion in Mali, as Tuareg rebels who have seized control over much of the north of the country declared a cease-fire in their drive to create an independent homeland.

In the capital, Mali's main political parties refused to participate in a national conference called by the military junta that toppled the country's democratically elected president last month.
The leader of the junta, which has said it seized power because of the civilian government's ineffective handling of the Tuareg uprising in the north, pleaded for international help in fighting the Tuaregs in an interview with the French newspaper Lib&amp;eacute;ration.
"If the great powers were able to cross oceans to fight against the Islamists, what prevents them from coming to us?" asked the junta leader, Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo, alluding to the war in Afghanistan.
But such assistance is unlikely. On Thursday, France ruled out a "military solution" in Mali, a former French colony, to counter the Tuareg rebels in the north, who announced that they had achieved their territorial objectives and were seeking outside backing for a breakaway state they call Azawad.
The declaration by the main Tuareg rebel group on its Web site came after other rebel fighters, who helped seize the ancient city of Timbuktu over the weekend, were quoted by local officials as saying that they planned to impose Islamic law there.
The Tuareg rebels have taken advantage of the military coup in Bamako, the capital, to press their separatist campaign, seizing a string of settlements in the northern desert with lightning speed.
In their statement, the rebel Tuareg fighters, calling themselves the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, said that they had decided "to unilaterally proclaim the end of military operations as of midnight on Thursday, April 5." The rebels said they had achieved "the complete liberation" of the territory they claim and invited outside powers to "guarantee the people of Azawad against all aggression by Mali."
The country is effectively divided between the south, controlled by mid-ranking officers who overthrew what had been seen internationally as a democratic government, and the rebels in the north, who have been strengthened by an influx of arms and fighters since the collapse of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's rule in Libya.
Speaking at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday, Mali's representative said the nation had never faced a graver crisis. "Our people are divided," Ambassador Omar Daou said. "Our country is threatened with partition."
In Paris, the French foreign minister, Alain Jupp&amp;eacute;, told reporters that there would be "no military solution with the Tuaregs &amp;mdash; there needs to be a political solution." He urged neighboring countries like Algeria and Mauritania to press for a political settlement.
The rebel takeover has deepened Western concerns that Islamic militants could turn the poor, remote desert reaches of northern Mali into a redoubt for the regional affiliate of Al Qaeda.
Mr. Jupp&amp;eacute; said France would not send its own troops to oppose the rebellion, but would be willing to offer logistical support for a regional force to support the Bamako authorities, specifically to fight Islamists linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb while negotiations got under way with secular Tuaregs.
Military commanders from the regional grouping known as Ecowas, which has suspended Mali and imposed economic sanctions against the nation because of the coup, met on Thursday in Ivory Coast to discuss their contributions to a 2,000-strong standby force to be created for possible intervention in Mali, The Associated Press reported.
Meanwhile, Iyad Ag Ghali, the leader of the Islamic rebel group known as Ansar ud-Din, said that following the proclamation of Islamic law in Timbuktu, women would be required to wear veils, thieves would be punished by having their hands severed and adulterers would be stoned to death, according to local officials and a radio journalist quoted by The A.P.
Separately, Mali's main political parties in Bamako said they would not take part in a national convention called by the military officers who ousted the nation's democratically elected leaders on March 22, The A.P. said. The army captain who led the coup proposed holding the convention on Thursday to find a political solution and to try to appease the foreign countries that are demanding that he immediately restore constitutional order.
