  <text>"We announce that unless the UN Security Council takes urgent steps for the protection of civilians, Annan's plan is going to go to hell," Al Jazeera cited the FSA's statement.
The statement comes the next day after the deadliest act of violence in Houla, a town in Homs province, where over 90 people were reported to be killed by the pro-government forces.
Syria child massacre confirmed by UN
UN observers have counted at least 90 bodies, including 32 children, after a Syrian government attack on a town.
UN mission head Maj-Gen Robert Mood told the BBC the killing in Houla was "indiscriminate and unforgivable". Syria's government has blamed the deaths on "armed terrorist gangs".
This is one of the bloodiest attacks in one area since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. Activists say some of the victims died by shelling, while others were summarily executed, or butchered by the regime militia known as the "shabiha".
Fighting in Syria has continued despite the deployment of some 250 UN observers monitoring a cease-fire brokered by UN envoy Kofi Annan. On Thursday, a UN-mandated panel said Syrian security forces were to blame for most abuses in the conflict, which has continued despite the presence of the UN observers.
Mr Annan's six-point peace agreement ordered a cessation of violence on 12 April. While casualties appeared to fall after the truce, the fighting quickly resumed to previous levels.
