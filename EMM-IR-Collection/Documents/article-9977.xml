  <text>The UN Security Council has unanimously approved the deployment of observers for Syria, in its first resolution on the conflict in the embattled nation. Up to 30 unarmed monitors are expected to leave within days.
The UN Security Council on Saturday passed its first resolution on the conflict in Syria, approving the deployment of up to 30 observers to the country. China and Russia came out in favor of Resolution 2042, after vetoing two previous attempts by the UN body.
The text calls on President Bashar al-Assad and his government "to guarantee the safety of the advance team without prejudice to its freedom of movement and access." France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud said sending the advance mission would "test whether Syria is serious about its engagements" before authorizing the full mission.
The resolution also calls upon the Syrian government to "implement visibly" all commitments under UN and Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan - including the withdrawal of all troops and heavy guns from Syrian cities.
A new resolution will be required for a more comprehensive monitoring mission of more than 200 observers.
Meanwhile, Syrian troops and rebel gunmen continued attacks across Syria on Saturday, killing at least six people and threatening the UN-brokered cease-fire.
The heaviest fighting was reported in the central city of Homs, where regime forces shelled rebel-held neighborhoods, while rebel fighters fired rocket-propelled grenades at an area of regime loyalists. In Aleppo, Syria's largest city, regime forces opened fire at a funeral, while rebel gunmen ambushed a car carrying soldiers in the southern province of Daraa.

The UN Security Council has unanimously approved the deployment of observers for Syria, in its first resolution on the conflict in the embattled nation. Up to 30 unarmed monitors are expected to leave within days.
China and the Philippines have reportedly ended their week-long standoff in an area in the South China Sea to which both countries lay claim.
China has doubled its currency's trading band against the US dollar for the first time since 2007. From Monday, the yuan's exchange rate with the dollar will be allowed to fluctuate by 1 percent, up from 0.5 percent.
A German-owned vessel carrying a shipment of Iranian weapons headed for Syria has been intercepted, according to the German magazine Der Spiegel.
