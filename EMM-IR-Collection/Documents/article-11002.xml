  <text>DAMASCUS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Head of the UN advance observers team to Syria said Monday that his colleagues are bracing to begin their task as soon as possible to monitor the truce in the country that was hit hard by a year-long political unrest.
"We are going to organize ourselves in order to do our task as soon as possible ... I'm very optimistic ... all peace keepers are optimistic," Moroccan Colonel Ahmed Himmiche told reporters while leaving his hotel along with other observers on Monday.
Himmiche said he is hopeful that the mission will succeed.
The five-member advance team of UN observers arrived in the capital Damascus overnight Sunday to monitor the cease-fire brokered by international envoy Kofi Annan that went into effect last Thursday.
The team's arrival came a day after the UN Security Council unanimously approved the observers' mission. The team will be backed with other batches of observers over the next period, and the total number of observers may eventually reach 250.
Earlier on Monday, another four UN monitors arrived in Damascus to join their colleagues.
"We will start our mission as soon as possible, and we hope that Annan's plan will succeed," Himmiche said.
On Sunday, Syrian presidential media advisor Buthiana Shabaan said it is for Syria's interest to have international observers on its territories, as the observers will help in exposing the crimes committed by armed groups.
Meanwhile, the state-run Tishrin newspaper said Damascus is " satisfied" with the UN resolution to send observers to the country "because it comes in the context of respecting the Syrian sovereignty and is in Syria's interest."
The paper added that Syria feels comfortable also because the resolution has shouldered all parties the responsibility of halting armed violence with all its forms.
The observers' mission came as part of the six-point plan initiated by Annan that meant to solve the Syrian crisis politically.
The plan calls for a troop withdrawal from populated areas by April 10 and a cease-fire by April 12, and also for allowing in foreign media and peaceful demonstrations.
In general, violence and death toll have to some extent declined in comparison with the previous stage, but clashes and attacks were still being reported during the fragile five-day-old truce.
