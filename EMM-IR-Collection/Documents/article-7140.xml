  <text>Kofi Annan: "I believe there should be no preconditions for stopping violence"
The international envoy on Syria, Kofi Annan, says his peace plan is "very much alive" despite fresh clashes breaking out in several cities.
He appealed to both Damascus and opposition groups to end the violence as a deadline for government troops to pull out of population centres passed.
According to his UN-backed plan, the army was to have completely withdrawn from conflict areas by Tuesday.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said some troops had pulled out.
Activist groups said at least 18 people were killed on Tuesday.
Military activity was also reported in Aleppo province in the north and Deraa in the south.
Speaking in Turkey after visiting refugee camps for people who have fled the fighting in Syria, Mr Annan said he had hoped his peace plan "would be further along at this time".
But he said it was not too late to implement it.
It may be too early to draw a definitive line under Kofi Annan's peace plan for Syria, but it is not looking in terribly good health"
He said he was preparing to report to the Security Council - meeting later on Tuesday - that according to sources, including "our own intelligence", Syrian troops had moved out of some areas but were moving to "other areas which have not previously been targets".
He said there was "rolling military action that we believe should stop".
The unrest in Syria, which began in March last year, had gone on too long, he said.
Under his plan, sponsored by the UN and the Arab League, Syrian troops were to have completed their withdrawal from population centres and stopped the use of heavy weaponry by Tuesday, ahead of a full ceasefire coming into place on Thursday.
Damascus had agreed to the deadline, but on Sunday demanded written guarantees first that its opponents would give up arms, along with a promise from foreign states not to fund them.
1. Syrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people
2. UN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians
3. All parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting, and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause
4. Authorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons
5. Authorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists
6. Authorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully
Speaking in Moscow, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the withdrawal had begun in some areas, but that the ceasefire should be timed to the arrival of international monitors - something Mr Annan said he was working towards.
But Mr Muallem said that "despite all these positive measures we noticed on a daily basis the escalation of opposition by the armed terrorist gangs".
Syrian opposition representatives have said they are committed to the peace plan but that if government troops did not stop firing by Thursday, they would intensify their own operations.
The Russian foreign ministry said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had urged Mr Annan in a telephone call to put pressure on countries backing the Syrian opposition to make sure they stuck to the ceasefire plan.
Earlier he said the Syrian government "could have been more active and decisive" in implementing the plan, but that Mr Muallem had assured him Damascus was committed to it.
