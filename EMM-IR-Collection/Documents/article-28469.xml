The members of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria said in a report Thursday that since March the Syrian government forces have killed people unlawfully during anti-government demonstrations in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo, Hama, Damascus and Dara and in "numerous villages throughout the country."
They also say that anti-government armed groups also have killed army and security forces and suspected informers that they have capture.

BEIRUT (AP) — Syria's main opposition council has accepted the resignation of its Paris-based president who had earlier offered to step down amid mounting criticism of his leadership.
The executive committee of the Syrian National Council asked Burhan Ghalioun to pursue his duties until a new president is elected at a meeting on June 9 and 10.
The committee also pledged in a statement issued late Wednesday to restructure the opposition council to make it more inclusive.
The SNC has been plagued by infighting and divisions since its inception in September, complicating Western efforts to bolster the opposition.
Ghalioun's offer to resign came just days after he was re-elected for a third, three month term in a controversial vote in Rome.
