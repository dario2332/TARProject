  <text>I am not quite content with the discussion results, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told reporters after the meeting.
He gave to understand that the resolution should deal with the core of the subject, be pragmatic and specific, which is not at all the case with the western version, abounding in ultimatums to the Syrian government and actually putting all the blame for the violence in the country on it.
The US Ambassador Susan Rice has, for her part, refrained from making predictions concerning the results of the voting that's due at 7 p.m. Moscow time tonight.
UN SC to vote today on sending UN observers to Syria
The UN Security Council will hold a vote today at 19:00 on a draft resolution to dispatch to Syria an advance team of UN observers. This was reported by the UN press service.
Earlier, it was expected that the document might be discussed on Friday night. According to information received, the project is a "hybrid" developed on the basis of Russian and American projects. According to it, up to 30 unarmed military observers will be sent to Syria. They will need to "establish a connection with all the sides, and begin to report on how they are meeting the condition to end violence in all forms".
Earlier, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov stressed that urgently dispatching UN observers was of key importance to maintaining the ceasefire regime in Syria.
