  <text>Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad shelled the battered city of Homs on Saturday, opposition activists said, the first bombings since a ceasefire began two days ago.
The United Nations Security Council is tentatively scheduled to vote on a Western-Arab draft resolution authorising an advance U.N. team to monitor the fragile ceasefire which aims to end 13 months of bloodshed during the uprising against Assad, reports Reuters.
"There was shelling last night in the old part of the city, in Jouret al-Shiyah and al-Qaradis. And I have heard eight shells fall in the past hour," Karm Abu Rabea, a resident activist who lives in an adjacent neighbourhood, said on Saturday morning.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and other activists in Homs said shelling had wounded several people overnight. Activist Walid al-Fares showed Reuters footage of a thick pillar of smoke rising next to a mosque minaret. The crack of gunfire can also be heard.
The Syrian government has repeatedly denied access to journalists, making it impossible to independently verify the reports.
Syrians took to the streets across the country in small demonstrations on Friday, trusting the truce would put an end to the bullets that have frightened off peaceful protesters for months.
But Syrian forces loyal to Assad shot dead five protesters after Friday prayers, activists reported, adding that security forces came out in strength in many cities to prevent protesters mounting major rallies against Assad.
Another group of assailants threw a stick of dynamite at an army patrol in the same city, SANA said, and a bomb exploded at a major roundabout.
"The main roads in some villages have seen a proliferation of armed men, especially in the towns," it added.
