  <text>ADEN, Yemen, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Intensified Yemeni airstrikes bombed several al-Qaida hideouts in the southern province of Lahj, killing a total of 45 militants on Tuesday, a government official told Xinhua.
The air strikes which were carried out by Yemeni air forces hit several hideouts of the terrorists, killing as many as 45 al-Qaida militants in Lahj's suburbs close to the insurgents-controlled town of Jaar in neighboring Abyan province, the local government official told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.
"The air raids on Tuesday are against al-Qaida hideouts in the mountainous area of Rahah in the suburbs of Lahj, where fierce battles took place between the government troops and militants during the past three days, leaving dozens of people killed," the official said.
"Some of the al-Qaida militants were killed late Monday during overnight air strikes on fortifications around the army base which was overran by the terrorists on Saturday," the intelligence officer said.
"The army forces were trying to regain control over the region, but did not make any progress for fear of suicide bombings," he added.
On Sunday, militants of the Yemen-based al-Qaida branch shot dead 15 army soldiers held captives during Saturday's fighting in the southern province of Lahj, according to military officials.
The Yemeni army and security forces have recently been attacked by the Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the restive southern regions. Hundreds of government troops were either killed or injured during deadly suicide bombings and fierce battles with al-Qaida insurgents in the province of Abyan during the past two months.
Taking advantage of the one-year-long political conflicts, the resurgent AQAP, locally known as Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law), has taken control of several cities and swathes across the country's restive southern provinces.
