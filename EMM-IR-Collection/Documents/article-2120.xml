Afghan president Hamid Karzai cut short his visit to Europe and Britain this morning to fly home after at least 59 people died in twin attacks on pilgrims at two Shia shrines.
Doctors and police struggled to count the casualties after the first blast, which tore through a crowd of pilgrims commemorating the Shiite holy day of Ashura in the capital Kabul.
Many women and children were among the casualties after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gates of the shrine.
It was one of the bloodiest days in the Afghan capital since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and came after similar attacks on Shiite pilgrims in Iraq on Monday.
Shortly after the Kabul blast, a bicycle bomb exploded near the main mosque in northern Mazar-i-Sharif city, killing four people.
The violence has prompted fears of sectarian unrest in Afghanistan and dozens of funerals will be held later today for the victims of the bombings.
"President Karzai will no longer be coming to London. He is flying back to Afghanistan following today's events," embassy spokesman Hanif Aman told the AFP news agency this morning.
Mr Karzai had been due to arrive in London late on Tuesday from Germany, where he had been attending an international conference on Afghanistan's future.
"This is the first time on such an important religious day in Afghanistan that terrorism of that horrible nature is taking place," Mr Karzai told journalists in Germany.
The attacks were swiftly condemned by the international community, with France calling them "cowardly and odious acts" and UK foreign secretary William Hague saying he was "shocked by the sectarian attacks on innocent civilians".
The Taliban denied responsibility for the bomb attacks, calling them the brutal work of "enemies", a spokesman for the insurgent group said.
"Very sadly we heard that there were explosions in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif, where people were killed by the enemy's un-Islamic and inhuman activity," Zabihullah Mujahid said in an emailed statement.
"The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns such a cruel, indiscriminate and un-Islamic attack," the statement added, using the name by which insurgent group refers to itself.
Shia Muslim leaders urged survivors to donate blood at nearby hospitals to help the injured.
Afghanistan has a history of tension and violence between Sunnis and the Shiite minority.
But since the fall of the Taliban, the country had been spared the large-scale sectarian attacks that have troubled neighbouring Pakistan.
Outside a hospital in central Kabul, mourners cried near a pile of bloodied clothes and shoes.
A woman in a dark headscarf clutching a bloodstained sports shoe said her son, in his early 20s, had died in the attack.
"They killed my son...this is his shoe," she said.
The Shiite Muslim festival of Ashura marks the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, Hussein, in the battle of Karbala in Iraq in the year 680.
Ashura is the biggest event in the Shiite Muslim calendar, when large processions are vulnerable to militant attacks, including suicide bombings.
Pakistan has deployed tens of thousands of paramilitary soldiers and police during Ashura.
Blood has spilled between Pakistan's majority Sunni and minority Shiite militants for decades.
Sectarian strife has intensified since Sunni militants deepened ties with Al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban insurgents after Pakistan joined the US-led campaign against militancy after the September 11 attacks.
