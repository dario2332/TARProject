  <text>DAMASCUS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The UN-Arab League joint special envoy Kofi Annan will set foot in Syria's capital of Damascus Monday to assess the implementation of his six-point peace plan, which was hardly pushed to the verge of collapse after a bloody massacre that killed more than 100 people in central Syria overnight Friday.
The visit timing was announced by Syria's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi Sunday during a press conference held to announce Syria's denial to any involvement of government troops in the bloodbath.
The UN said at least 108 people, including 49 children and 34 women were killed in the massacre, in the central area of Houla, a group of villages some 25 kilometers northwest of the central city of Homs.
The opposition and the Syrian government have spent the past two days trading accusations and blaming one another for the appalling slaughtering of women and children in Houla.
Activists claimed that Houla came under heavy shelling from Syrian forces, and later on by raids and attacks from supporters of the Syrian regime who had allegedly stormed into houses and stabbed women, men and children.
The Syrian government, however, blamed the massacre on a " terrorist" group affiliated with al-Qaida, contending that the " terrorist" escalation came ahead of an imminent meeting of the UN Security Council and the UN special envoy Kofi Annan to Syria.
On Sunday, Makdissi categorically denied any responsibility for the Syrian forces in the Houla massacre, saying "we condemn with the strongest term this terrorist massacre."
Overnight Friday, heavily armed groups riding trucks rigged with various heavy weaponries, including mortars, machine-guns and anti-tank missiles, gathered at Houla, said Makdissi, adding that they attacked the posts of only five law-enforcement forces deployed there, who clashed with the armed groups for self-defense.
Makdissi said that armed groups came from the central towns of Rastan and Qusair near Homs, charging that they have had premeditated intentions to carry out the deadly assault.
He noted that the attacks came in parallel with Annan's visit to Syria in a bid to hit the political process.
The massacre sparked a crescendo of international condemnation.
The UN Security Council on Sunday condemned "in the strongest possible terms" the killings of more than 100 people in Syria, saying that those responsible for the massacre should be held accountable.
The 15-nation Security Council requested the UN secretary- general, with the involvement of UN observer mission to Syria, to continue to investigate and report the findings to the council.
The council also demanded the Syrian government to immediately pull back its troops and heavy weapons in and around population centers and return them to barracks.
It reiterated full support to the efforts of Annan's six-point plan in its entirety and requested him to convey in the clearest terms to the Syrian parties, and in particular the Syrian government, the demands of the Security Council.
The six-point plan calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons and troops from population centers, a daily halt in fighting for the delivery of humanitarian aid and treatment for the wounded, as well as talks between the government and opposition.
Also, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Sunday that the "indiscriminate and possibly deliberate" killing of villagers in Houla may mount to crimes against humanity or other forms of international crime.
"Those who order such attacks, assist them, or fail to stop them, are individually criminally liable for their actions," she said.
The violence in Syria continued unabatedly despite the deployment of more than 250 UN observers, who arrived in Syria last month to shore up a cease-fire truce, part of Annan's plan that has not taken hold despite pledges from the government and the opposition to curb the violence. Both sides blame each other for the prolonged violence.
Observers believe that the recent developments in Syria that took the sectarian nature will toughen the challenge for Annan's ailing peace efforts.
The rebel Free Syrian Army has reportedly said had the international community failed to undertake measures to protect the civilians in Syria after the recent massacre, "let the Annan's plan then go to hell."
