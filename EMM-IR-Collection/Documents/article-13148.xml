  <text>The internationally-backed ceasefire in Syria is in a fragile state and the situation on the ground is not good, a spokesperson for the plan's architect Kofi Annan said on Friday.
Ahmad Fawzi said there were new victims of violence every day.
"The situation on the ground is not good. It's a very fragile ceasefire," Annan's spokesperson told reporters.
Damascus signed on Thursday a preliminary agreement on the work of the UN observers dispatched to Syria to monitor the ceasefire.
The agreement covers the work of both the advance mission and the full team expected to be deployed following a further Security Council vote, he said.
As part of the accord, observers will have complete freedom of movement and will be allowed to contact anyone they wish, said Fawzi.
The spokesperson said that the advance team is currently made up of seven members on the ground.
"Two more are arriving on Monday to bring those on the ground to nine.”
Fawzi said he hoped the Security Council would give the green light for the full mission of 300 observers as quickly as possible.
"The next step is for the Security Council to adopt a resolution," he said. "We are preparing for the deployment because we feel it will happen."
