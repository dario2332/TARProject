The Prime Minister invited Ms Suu Kyi to come to the UK in June, as he called 
  for Europe to suspend its ban on trade with the country now that it is 
  moving towards democracy.
Mr Cameron became the first Western leader to meet Ms Suu Kyi at her lakeside 
  villa, where she has spent 15 of the last 22 years under house arrest by the 
She was released from custody in November 2010 and elected to parliament in a 
  sweeping victory earlier this year.
Appearing alongside Ms Suu Kyi on her verandah, Mr Cameron said Britain is now 
He agreed with Ms Suu Kyi that the country, now known as Myanmar, is showing 
  "prospects for change", after its military rulers held its first elections 
  and released some political prisoners.

How do we holiday ethically in Burma?
"We must always be sceptical and questioning because we want to know those 
  changes are irreversible, but as we have discussed, I think it is right to 
  suspend the sanctions that there are against Burma - to suspend them, not to 
  lift them," he said.
A suspension would open the door to a rush for oil, mining and timber 
  resources in the impoverished country, if it is approved at a European Union 
  meeting later this month.
The Prime Minister extended the invitation to visit Britain during a 
  tete-a-tete with Ms Suu Kyi, before they were joined by Andy Heyn, the 
  British Ambassador to Myanmar, private secretaries and press advisers, for 
  tea and traditional Burmese sweets.
In a small, spartan room in her house, they spoke about how to secure the 
  release of political prisoners, whether sanctions should be suspended and 
  how Britain can help strengthen the country's rule of law.
Ms Suu Kyi, who was this year elected to parliament in a landslide electoral 
  victory, backed the Prime Minister's calls for a suspension of sanctions.
"This would strengthen the hand of the reformers - not just the suspension but 
  the fact that there is always a possibility of sanctions coming back again 
  if the reforms are not allowed to proceed smoothly," she said.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate left Britain for Myanmar in 1988 to help nurse 
  her mother but she was held in custody at her house soon afterwards.
She refused to leave the country, even when her husband, Michael Aris, an 
  Oxford University academic, was dying in Britain in 1999, because the regime 
  would not have let her back in.
Mr Cameron said he was honoured to invite the "inspirational" opposition 
  leader back to see "her beloved Oxford" in the knowledge that she would be 
  able to return home again.
After the invitation, Ms Suu Kyi said: "Two years ago, I would have said 
  thank you for the invitation but sorry. Now I am able to say perhaps. That 
Earlier, the Prime Minister held talks with Thein Sein, the president of 
  Myanmar, who has overseen the country's steps towards democracy.
Arriving early in the morning , Mr Cameron became the only serving British 
  Prime Minister to set foot in the country since its independence in 1948.
Downing Street sources said the Prime Minister is now "cautiously 
  optimistic for the future" of Myanmar as a democracy and believes the 
  president is "sincere in what has happened so far".
He is understood to feel that Myanmar is like East Germany looking over the 
  wall into West Germany and realising the future is in democracy.
The Prime Minister was hosted for a Western-style lunch at the President's 
  luxurious mock-Georgian gold and cream palace, with a menu of prawn salad, 
  poached salmon, lamp chops and apple tart.
On his way to the palace through the capital of Naypyitaw, the Prime 
  Minister's official car and convoy of coaches was soaked with hoses of water 
  as he arrived in the country on the day of the Thingyan water festival of 
Crowds of waving young people danced to music in the spray, as the cars and 
  buses passed on a route lined by military guards.
Sources said the talks at the palace were "formal, but frank", with the 
  president flanked by eight Burmese government ministers in traditional 
The meeting only lasted for 40 minutes and was slowed down by consecutive, 
  rather than simultaneous, translation.
Their talks focused on Myanmar's desire to have European trade sanctions 
  lifted and how the country would need to improve its governance and reduce 
They also discussed the President's need to win over the support for reforms 
  of some senior people in his own country, which is still heavily under the 
  influence of the military.
Mr Cameron is understood to believe that Burma realises it is stuck in a dead 
  end, after seeing the prosperity capitalism has brought to neighbours such 
  as Indonesia and Malaysia.
Afterwards, the two leaders exchanged gifts, with Mr Cameron handing over a 
  glass bowl and receiving a traditional Burmese painting.
Later, Mr Cameron was due to have a private dinner with Ms Suu Kyi at the 
  residence of the Mr Heyn, the ambassador.
Mr Heyn yesterday wrote of his amazement that Myanmar could have come so far 
  towards ending its international isolation so quickly.
"When I arrived here in July 2009, the prospect of such a senior visit 
  was so far-fetched as to be absurd," he said.
Campaign groups cautiously welcomed a suspension of sanctions, rather than a 
  call for them to be lifted.
Anna Roberts, executive director of the Burma Campaign UK, said: "The 
  suspension of EU sanctions keeps the pressure on the Burmese government to 
  continue reforms, while also making a strong positive gesture that genuine 
  reforms will be rewarded.
"Despite reforms, Burma is still a country with one of the worst human 
  rights records in the world, and where the military has constitutional 
  control over every level of government. Burma is still a very long way from
