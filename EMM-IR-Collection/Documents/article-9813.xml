  <text>Syrian forces shelled two central districts in the battered city of Homs throughout the night and into Saturday morning, a resident activist and a human rights group told Reuters, the first bombings since a cease-fire began Thursday.
"There was shelling last night in the old part of the city, in Jouret al-Shiyah and al-Qaradis. And I have heard eight shells fall in the past hour," Karm Abu Rabea, a resident activist who lives in an adjacent neighborhood, said Saturday morning, according to the news agency.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told Reuters that shelling had wounded several people overnight.
On Friday, Syrian forces used live fire, tear gas and clubs to beat back tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets across the country in often jubilant displays of defiance, The Associated Press said.
Syrians take to streets in test of truce
Activists said security forces killed at least six people, a lower-than-usual toll, The AP reported.
The rallies, described as some of the largest in months, stretched from the suburbs of Damascus to the central province of Hama, Idlib in the north and the southern province of Daraa, where the uprising began in March 2011.
"Come on, Bashar, leave!" the crowd shouted in Daraa, linking arms and stomping their feet to the beat of a drum in a traditional Arab folk dance, The AP reported, citing a video posted online by activists.

The United Nations Security Council is due to vote Saturday on a resolution that would allow the deployment of international monitors in Syria.
Ahmad Fawzi, a spokesman for U.N. envoy Kofi Annan, told BBC News that "we have the advance team [of monitors] standing by to board planes and to get there, to get themselves on the ground as soon as possible."
The BBC reported that activists claimed there had been more than 750 demonstrations across Syria Friday, including one in Hama.
"We tried our best to reach Assi Square in order to show the world the truth about the regime -- they are lying and will not allow us to have big, peaceful demonstrations," Mousab Hamadee, an activist in that city, told the BBC. "As we approached Assi Square, they started opening fire on us. Two of my colleagues were martyred."
