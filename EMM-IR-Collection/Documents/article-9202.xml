UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan has said that a ceasefire in Syria appears to be holding but President Bashar al-Assad must carry out all parts of an agreed peace plan.
"I am encouraged by reports that the situation in Syria is relatively calm and that the cessation of hostilities appears to be holding," Mr Annan said in a statement released as he briefed the UN Security Council on the Syria crisis.
There are no reports of fresh violence in Syria after a ceasefire came into effect this morning.
An activist in Damascus said the capital was also quiet.
That view was echoed by opposition Syrian National Council spokesman Ausama Monajed.

However, Syrian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Dr Jihad Makdissi said his government would observe the ceasefire, as long as its opponents did too.
Meanwhile, Mr Annan is said to have called on the UN Security Council to demand that Syrian troops are moved away from protest cities back to their barracks.
Envoys at a closed Security Council meeting quoted Mr Annan as saying that while the Syrian government is technically not meeting commitments to a peace plan, a current fragile ceasefire was "a chance to be seized."
Mr Annan asked the 15-nation council to demand that Syrian troops be ordered back to barracks and to authorise the quick deployment of an observer mission, a diplomat in the meeting said.
The UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed in Syria in the past 13 months.
