Syrian activists prepare signs for upcoming protests at a house in a neighborhood in Damascus (AP)
The latest violence comes despite Syrian president Bashar Assad's agreement to implement a ceasefire starting on April 10.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops are clashing with rebel army defectors in the northern towns of Hraytan and Anadan near Aleppo.
The Observatory also reported fighting in the Damascus suburb of Douma and the southern village of Kfar Shams.
The truce is the keystone of a plan put forward by Kofi Annan, the joint UN-Arab League envoy, aimed at ending the country's year-long crisis.
Mohammed Abu Nasr, an activist in Hraytan, said the town of about 50,000 has been subjected to intense shelling by tanks and helicopters since 5am local time.
He added that a ground offensive began three hours later and hundreds of troops are pushing their way into the town.
"There are wounded people in the streets that we cannot reach because of the shelling," Abu Nasr said by telephone. "The situation is catastrophic in the city. Large numbers of people are fleeing."
Hraytan is just north of Aleppo, which has been relatively quiet since Syria's uprising began in March 2011 when protesters inspired by other Arab Spring revolts took to the streets to call for political reform. The regime has tried to violently quash spreading dissent, and many in the opposition have since taken up arms to protect themselves and attack government troops.
An amateur video posted online by activists showed smoke billowing from several areas in Anadan as the narrator said the shelling was taking place this morning. Another video showed Anadan shortly before sunrise as cracks of heavy gunfire echoed while prayers could be heard blaring from mosque loudspeakers.
