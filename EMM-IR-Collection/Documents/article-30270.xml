  <text>Tens of thousands of activists took to the streets of Aleppo and Idlib on Friday, braving the gunfire of Syrian troops, as at least 24 people were killed across the country, monitors said.
The latest violence came as Kofi Annan, the UN-Arab League envoy to Syria who brokered a repeatedly-violated ceasefire last month, finalised plans to return to Damascus.
For the second consecutive Friday, "tens of thousands of people marched in Aleppo city and province," calling for regime change, said the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman.
"They are the most important protests in Aleppo" since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March last year, he added, saying 12 separate demonstrations had taken place in Syria's second city.
