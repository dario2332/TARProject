  <text>Meanwhile, Syria has retaliated against northern neighbour Turkey for the sanctions imposed by its former friend.
In a display of military might that could be intended to deter foreign military intervention in a crisis that has killed at least 4,000 people, the army staged a big exercise with missiles, rockets, tanks and helicopters.
Activist website Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five civilians were killed by security forces in Homs, the country's third largest city.
Four died when troops fired on a funeral procession and one man was shot at a hospital. A youth died of gunshot wounds sustained at the weekend.
In southern Deraa province, three members of the security forces were shot dead by army defectors in front of the Dael courthouse, the website said.
Sanctions imposed by former allies Turkey followed those from the United States and Europe and planned sanctions from Arab League neighbours.
Syria responded to Turkish sanctions by imposing a tariff of 30% on its imports and prohibitive duties on fuel and freight.
State news agency Sana quoted an economist who supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as saying Turkey would be "the biggest loser".
