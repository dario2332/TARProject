  <text>Afghan army special forces and the police used rocket-propelled grenades to fight the insurgents equipped with automatic weapons during the street fighting.
The Afghan Defence Ministry spokesperson said 32 insurgents died in the attacks while one was captured by the security personnel. Three Afghan soldiers were killed and 10 others  wounded.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks, but some officials said the Haqqanis, a network of tribal militants who live along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, were likely involved.
Taliban said the attack had been planned for months and is the beginning of the "spring offensive." Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters that the attack was an act of vengeance against the recent incidents of the burning of Korans at a NATO base and the massacre of 17 Afghan civilians by a US soldier.
He linked the Haqqani network with the Kabul Attack Network, which in turn, has been linked to the ISI Directorate.
However, the Taliban has claimed the entire credit for the attacks, distancing itself from the Haqqani network.
The attacks have raised fears over the security situation in Afghanistan as the NATO prepares for the withdrawal of troops by the end of 2014 leaving the regional security to the Afghan forces. Ryan Crocker, the US Ambassador, said the ability of the Afghan security forces to respond to the attacks was a "clear sign of progress."
