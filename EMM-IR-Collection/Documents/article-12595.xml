Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is not underestimating the gravity of the situation in Syria but believes there is an opportunity for progress and recommended the Security Council approve a 300-strong UN observer mission.
Mr Ban said in a letter to the council that he will consider developments on the ground, including consolidation of the cease-fire, before deciding on when to deploy the expanded mission, which is larger than the 250 observers initially envisioned.
The UN chief said the level of violence dropped markedly on April
12, the day a cease-fire called for by international envoy Kofi Annan went into effect, but that violent incidents and reported casualties have escalated again in recent days and "the cessation of armed violence
in all its forms is therefore clearly incomplete".
At the same time, Mr Ban said, the Syrian
government and opposition have continued to express their commitment to
a cease-fire and have agreed to cooperate with a UN observer mission.
"I remain deeply concerned about the gravity of the situation in the country," he said.
"However, without underestimating the serious challenges ahead, an opportunity for progress may now exist, on which we need to build."
Mr Ban said Syria has not fully implemented its initial requirement under Mr Annan's six-point
plan to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns and cities and return them to barracks.
He said members of the small advance team on the ground in Syria
enjoyed freedom of movement on a visit to the southern city of Daraa on
Tuesday where they saw buses and trucks with soldiers dispersed throughout the city.
Yesterday, he said, the advance team visited Jobar, Zamalka and Arbeen in suburban Damascus and reported the presence of military at checkpoints and around some public squares and buildings in all three locations.
In Arbeen, he said, one armoured personnel carrier was hidden, covered by a plastic sheet.
"The situation in Arbeen became tense when a crowd that was part of an opposition demonstration forced United Nations vehicles to a checkpoint," Mr Ban said.
"Subsequently, the crowd was dispersed by firing projectiles. Those responsible for the firing could not be ascertained by the United Nations military observers."
The secretary-general said no injuries were observed by the advance team but one UN vehicle "was damaged slightly during the incident".
Mr Ban said the team's initial request to visit Homs - the city at the centre of the 13-month conflict - "was not granted, with officials claiming security concerns".
