  <text>UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan said on Tuesday there was still time to implement a peace plan to stop the violence in Syria, as the opposition said there was no sign the government was pulling troops from residential areas and shelling attacks continued, dpa reported.
"We still have time between now and the 12th to stop the violence," Annan said during a press conference in Turkey, referring to Thursday's deadline for a ceasefire to take hold.
Annan's plan, which calls for the Syrian army to start withdrawing on Tuesday morning and for a ceasefire to follow within 48 hours, appears be faltering with violence continuing despite the approaching ceasefire deadline.
The opposition Syrian National Council (SNC) said government forces killed some 1,000 civilians since President Bashar al-Assad announced two weeks ago that he would accept the peace plan.
"Yesterday was the worst day of the one-year revolution," with 168 people killed by the regime's forces, the council's head of foreign relations, Basma Kadmani, who is based in Paris, told dpa.
Shelling and shooting attacks in Syria killed 45 people Tuesday, the opposition said.
"The SNC refuses to allow al-Assad to turn Annan's peace plan into new excuse to kill", said SNC head Burhan Ghalioun.
Annan, who visited a refugee camp in Turkey's Hatay province near the Syrian border called on the Syrian government to honor its commitment to withdraw the army from residential areas under the plan.
"This has gone on for too long and it is time for the violence to stop and for the military to go back to their barracks," Annan said.
"I think there should be no preconditions to stop the violence and this is something we should do for the people. I appeal to all, the government in the first place ... to stop the violence," he added.
Annan added that he was unable to verify reports by the Syrian government that troops had pulled from some areas and that he had asked the UN Security Council to debate sending international peace observers to Syria to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire.
Speaking in Moscow where he held talks with Russian officials, Syrian Foreign Minsiter Walid al-Moallem said any international observers must be neutral.
"Kofi Annan has told me in telephone conversations that his ceasefire plan would bring the complete disarmament of armed groups in Syria, but how would this be possible if deliveries of weapons to rebel forces, and their transfer into Syria, is going to continue thanks to Turkey?" al-Moallem said.
"We already have pulled back some military units from certain Syrian provinces," he told a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
The Kremlin appeared to increase pressure on its traditional ally, with Lavrov calling on al-Assad to respect the ceasefire plan.
"We emphatically demand that our Syrian colleagues as they - as they have promised - strictly fulfill the terms of the peace plan as laid out by Kofi Annan, the special emissary from the UN and the League of Arab States," Lavrov said.
The opposition said there was no sign the Syrian army was pulling out from residential areas.
"Nothing has changed on the ground. All the tanks are still positioned inside populated areas. The regime has simply defied the UN plan, which was not a surprise," Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told dpa.
"If the truce deal set by Annan collapses, Syria will be moving closer and closer toward civil war," Abdul-Rahman said.
"What al-Moallem said in Moscow is a total lie and part of the Syrian regime's manoeuvres," SNC member Anas Airout told dpa.
Opposition rebels said they would order a ceasefire only after the government honors its the ceasefire conditions.
Rebels killed six soldiers in an attack in the the north-eastern province of Hassakeh, the observatory said.
Government forces shelled neighbourhoods of the flashpoint cities of Homs and Hama, as well as in the northern province of Aleppo.
The opposition Local Coordination Committees, which documents violence in Syria, said government forces killed 45 people, most of them were believed to be from the central province of Homs.
Syrian government restrictions on the media make it difficult to independently verified reports from Syria.
