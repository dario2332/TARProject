  <text>Two foreign journalists have been killed by Syrian government troops shelling the southern city of Homs.
In Paris, the government of France identified the two as Remi Ochlik, a French photographer, and Marie Colvin, an American reporter. Colvin was reported elsewhere to have been working for the Sunday Times in Britain.
Omar Shaker, a Syrian activist, said the two journalists were killed Wednesday when several rockets hit the garden of a house used by activists and journalists in the besieged Homs neighbourhood of Baba Amr.
The CBC's Susan Ormiston, who reported from Syria in January, said Wednesday that Colvin "had snuck in … smuggled in through the Lebanese or Turkish border, with escorts, Free Syrian Army escorts. She said in [a] report on Sunday that her house had already been shelled, and they must have moved to another accommodation which was hit by … shelling this morning."
"It's reported that as these journalists escaped this house, they were hit with rocket attacks, and that's how Marie Colvin was killed. The second journalist is a young French photographer who won a World Press Award this year for covering Libya. His name is Remi Ochlik, and he was there covering the crisis in Homs. By my count, we are now looking at four journalists who have been killed in the Homs area since January."
The government crackdown killed more than 5,400 people last year, the UN has estimated.
Homs has been one of the cities hit hardest. Activists say hundreds of people were killed this month in the city.
Colvin, a highly experienced war reporter, was interviewed earlier this week in Homs by a British journalist about the nature of the conflict in the city.
"The Syrians are not allowing civilians to leave," she said. "Anyone who gets on the street, if they're not hit by a shell, they're sniped. There are snipers all around Baba Amr [neighbourhood] on the high buildings.
"I think the sickening thing is the complete merciless nature. They're hitting civilian buildings … and the scale of it is just shocking."
A man in a video obtained by Reuters said there were still three wounded journalists where Colvin and Ochlik had been killed.
"This is the American journalist Marie Colvin, and this is French journalist Remi Ochlik," the man filmed in front of the house said, "and there are still three wounded journalists among them a journalist with Le Figaro in critical condition. This journalist working in the Sunday Times and what you can see is the aftermath of the shelling and they are still here and the shelling is still continuing."
