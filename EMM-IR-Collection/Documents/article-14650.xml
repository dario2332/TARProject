Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s talks to strengthen China-US ties have been marred by a dissident’s predicament. The Chinese activist has sought US asylum, but it remains to be seen if the US will risk damning relations by granting the request.
A human rights activist prosecuted by Beijing is believed to have found shelter with the US embassy. The case triggered the greatest strain in ties between the two in decades. But ahead of high-level talks officials are keeping an awkward silence.
The arrival of the Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping in the US comes at a testing time in relations between these economic giants. The two sides are expected to work on ties against the backdrop of a US military build-up around China.
The APEC Forum in Hawaii is over. Russian political scientist Igor Panarin thinks that the forum saw the start of open rivalry between the two superpowers: China and the USA.
A week after vetoes from Russia and China put an end to a UN resolution on Syria its supporters are coming back with another draft.

A Chinese dissident seeking asylum in the US has overshadowed bilateral negotiations between the two countries. The case comes at a crucial time for China-US relations, raising suspicions it may have been orchestrated to serve diplomatic interests.
Officially Chen Guangcheng’s situation only serves to put strain on ties between the two nations and impede potential progress in economic and political policy. However, the ensuing political posturing sees both sides jostling for influence.
Prominent dissident Chen has appealed directly to the US Congress and asked to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, currently in China for diplomatic talks.
The US Statement Department said on Friday that Chen has a fellowship at an American University and expects China to take care of his travel arrangements.
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Chen’s wife and two children would be allowed to accompany him abroad as he embarks on his fellowship.
In the telephone call to Congress, Chen had previously said he feared for the safety of his wife and children and wanted a “rest” in the US. He left the shelter of the US embassy in Beijing on Wednesday, but regretted the decision, only realizing the full extent of the threat to his family after his departure.
The Chinese government suggested a compromise, saying that Chen could leave China by applying for a student position in the US.
They previously struck out at the US government for “meddling” in the case and have demanded an official apology from Washington for the affront.
Hillary Clinton is wrapping up a diplomatic mission to strengthen economic and political ties with Beijing in what has been hailed as a high point in the countries’ relations.
However, dialogue has been overshadowed by dissident Chen’s case with many questioning its coincidence with the bilateral talks. The controversial case highlights human rights violations in China and has the potential to embarrass Beijing and undermine its authority.
Former CIA analyst Chris Johnson, now part of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says in article on that organization’s website that Chinese-US relations had almost reached “the perfect storm.”
He cited the case of corrupt politician Bo Xilai and alleged reports that the US was planning to sell Taiwan the F-16 fighter jet to add to its air fleet.
“For the conspiracy-minded in Beijing, and there are plenty of them, they will see these things as completing the circle of a US containment strategy designed to stifle China’s rise,” said Chris Johnson.
Columnist Francesco Sisci told RT that it was very possible that somebody “tried to plant the scandal as a thorn between the US and China” and that the blind activist must have had help to escape captivity.
“If it was orchestrated they must have had the support of the local police and maybe also someone in America,” said Sisci.
He emphasized that China-US relations were entering a “tricky time” with both sides adapting to China’s growing status as a global superpower.
US President Barack Obama’s opposition has also seized on Chen’s case, branding it as indicative of his weak foreign policy.
Obama’s Republican presidential competitor Mitt Romney has branded the administration’s treatment of Chen Guangcheng’s case as a “failure.”
“The reports are, if they are accurate, that our administration wittingly or unwittingly communicated to Chen an implicit threat to his family and also probably sped up or may have sped up the process of his decision to leave the embassy," Romney said at a campaign event on Thursday.
He added that if reports were true, “it’s a day of shame for the Obama administration.”
Obama has come under fire recently from his Republican opponents for his foreign policy. Namely for his controversial use of the killing of Osama Bin Laden as the centerpiece of his re-election campaign.
Romney said Chen’s case was yet more evidence that the president has not been standing up to authoritarian governments like Syria and Iran.
A delegation of Syrian rebels has made a deal with Pristina authorities to exchange experience of partisan warfare. Syrian opposition is sending militants to Kosovo for adopting tactics and being trained to oust President Bashar Assad’s regime.
Egypt's military police have fired water cannons to disperse a thousands-strong crowd of protesters in front of Egypt’s Ministry of Defense headquarters. Egypt’s Health Ministry says four people have been injured in clashes so far.
The laws the US has passed recently such as the NDAA means America can no longer criticize China about 'human rights violations' without being made to look completely hypocritical.
