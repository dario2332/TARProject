  <text>U.S. officials say that dozens of people, including children, were killed by Syrian government forces in the central town of Houla. NBC's Richard Engel reports. Warning: Some of the images are disturbing.
Updated at 11:54 a.m. ET -- Facing mounting international outrage over the killing of at least 109 people, including dozens of children, in the restive town of Houla, Syria on Sunday accused rebels of carrying out the massacre.
Images of bloodied and lifeless young bodies, lain carefully side by side after the onslaught on Friday, triggered shock around the world and underlined the failure of a six-week-old U.N. cease-fire plan to stop the violence.
Syrian authorities blamed "terrorists" for the massacre, among the worst carnage in the 14-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, which has cost about 10,000 lives.
"Women, children and old men were shot dead. This is not the hallmark of the heroic Syrian army," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdesi told reporters in Damascus.
Opposition activists said Assad's forces shelled Houla after a protest and then clashed with fighters from the Sunni Muslim-led insurgency.
Activists say Assad's 'shabbiha' militia, loyal to an establishment dominated by members of the minority Alawite sect, then hacked dozens of the victims to death, or shot them.
Maysara al-Hilawi said he saw the bodies of six children and their parents in a ransacked house in the town.
"The Abdelrazzak family house was the first one I entered. The children's corpses were piled on top of each other, either with their throats cut or shot at close range," Hilawi, an opposition activist, said by telephone from the area.
"I helped collect more than 100 bodies in the last two days, mostly women and children. The last were six members of the al-Kurdi family. A father and his five kids. The mother is missing," he said.
Damascus protesters shot deadSyrian forces shot dead two men on Sunday at a protest in Damascus against the killings in Houla, opposition activists said. The men's funerals also turned into demonstrations.
Footage broadcast by activists in the Damascus suburb of Yalda showed a crowd of hundreds at one of the men's funerals shouting "the people want the downfall of the regime."

A picture released by the Syrian opposition's Shaam News Network allegedly shows smoke billowing following a blast targeting a Syrian security forces vehicle on the ringroad outside the Damascus Mazze district early Sunday.
U.N. military and civilian observers counted 32 children under 10 years old among at least 92 dead in Houla on Saturday. More bodies have since been found, activists said.
The observers confirmed the use of artillery, which only Assad's forces have, but did not say how all the victims died.
The U.N. and Arab League's Syria envoy Kofi Annan and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon accused the Syrian government of using artillery in populated areas.
"This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian Government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms," they said in a joint statement on Saturday.
Western countries and Arab states opposed to Assad put the blame for the deaths squarely on Damascus.
The Gulf Cooperation Council of Sunni-led monarchies accused Assad's soldiers of using excessive force and urged the international community to "assume its responsibilities to halt the daily bloodshed in Syria".
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton spoke of a "heinous act perpetrated by the Syrian regime against its own civilian population" in a statement on Sunday. The head of the European parliament said it could amount to a war crime.
'Rule by murder'"We are horrified by credible reports of targeting killing, including stabbing and ax attacks on women and children in Houla. These acts serve as a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality," U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Sunday.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton demanded that those who carried out the killings be held to account.
"The United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end," she said.
France said it would call a meeting of the Friends of Syria, a group of Western and Arab countries keen to see Assad removed.
Britain said it would summon Syria's envoy over the massacre and that it would call for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council in coming days.
The United Arab Emirates requested an urgent meeting of the Arab League, whose head, Nabil Elaraby, urged the U.S. Security Council to stop the killing.
But there was no immediate official word from Russia, which along with China has vetoed Security Council resolutions calling for tougher action. Russia has previously blamed both the government and Syrian rebels for causing the violence.
Former U.N. Secretary-General Annan is to brief the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday and is likely to be guided on who is responsible by reports from U.N. observers in Houla.
Although the ceasefire plan negotiated by Annan has failed to stop the violence, the United Nations is nearing full deployment of a 300-strong unarmed observer force meant to monitor a truce.
The plan calls for a truce, withdrawal of troops from cities and dialogue between government and opposition.
Syria calls the revolt a "terrorist" conspiracy run from abroad, a veiled reference to Sunni Muslim Gulf powers that want to see weapons provided to the insurgents.
The United Nations has accused Assad's forces and insurgents alike of grave human rights abuses, including summary executions and torture.

Iran state TV: We'll build second nuclear plant
Hello folks, when will we discard our Imperialistic mindset? This is just another ploy by the U.S. and the U.N. to perpetrate the war mongering and demonizing as the U.S. is trying to drum up more support for another war. We've caused enough trouble around the world.  If you can't see that we are the instigators in most of the world's wars and displacement of millions of people who are fleeing our aggression, than you are not paying attention. If you don't think we have been in Syria covertly arming  the rebels you are in denial and forgetting about Libya. We need to stay out of other country's civil disputes. I hope we aren't going to go against the United Nations vote earlier this year and unilaterally go into Syria under the pretext that we need to stop the violence like we did in Libya. General Wesley Clark has stated that a Syria invasion has been pre-planned for quite awhile.
General Wesley Clark: "America will take out 7 countries in 5 years"
According to Former NATO supreme allied commander, former presidential candidate and 4 star US General Wesley Clark that they had received a memo that America is going to take out 7 countries in the Middle East starting with Iraq, Libya, Syria Lebanon Sudan, Somalia, and finally Iran. It is amazing how these things that were planned years ago and even though it is taking longer than originally planned, are being achieved in front of our eyes.
Why is it other countries feel like they have to defend their territory? Could it be that they know we have no problem invading their sovereignty just as we have done to countless other countries. Since World War II, 90% of the casualties of war are unarmed civilians. 1/3 of them children. Our victims have done nothing to us. From Palestine to Afghanistan to Iraq to Somalia to wherever our next target may be, their murders are not collateral damage, they are the nature of modern warfare. They don't hate us because of our freedoms. They hate us because every day we are funding and committing crimes against humanity. The so-called "war on terror" is a cover for our military aggression to gain control of the resources of western Asia.
This is sending the poor of this country to kill the poor of those Muslim countries. This is trading blood for oil. This is genocide, and to most of the world, we are the terrorists. In these times, remaining silent on our responsibility to the world and its future is criminal. And in light of our complicity in the supreme crimes against humanity in Iraq and Afghanistan, and ongoing violations of the U.N. Charter in International Law, how dare any American criticize the actions of legitimate resistance to illegal occupation.
We are going into Syria for a couple of reasons (yes we are in Syria with our Drones at a minimum), one, we are trying to dislodge Russia from there because they have a foothold in the Middle East via two military bases in Latakia and Tartus in Syria. Two, Syria is a strong ally of Iran. If we invade Syria we take out a strong ally and maybe incite Iran to assist giving the U.S. the reason they are looking for to attack Iran. The ultimate goal is to surround, weaken and to invade Iran. The petro dollar is at stake as other countries are switching to other forms of currency in buying Iran's oil.
Since the Russian war in 1828, Iran has never attacked another country. We on the other hand have attacked to name a few:  Libya, Iran, Nicaragua, Haiti, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Honduras, Chile, Congo, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, Angola, Columbia, Peru, Panama, Yemen, Pakistan, Grenada, Mexico, etc..
Wake up people we are being herded down the Military Industrial Complex gauntlet again to another false war to enrich the greedy Corporations and distract the American people. Did we not learn anything from the Iraq war where we have killed well over 1 million Iraqi people, lost thousands of American lives and God knows how many hundreds of billions of dollars?
Who do you support, humanity or the greedy elite?
Many of our soldiers don't fight for America, they fight for their lives and their buddies beside them, because we put them in a war zone. They're not defending our freedoms, they're laying the foundation for permanent military bases to defend the freedoms of Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum.
Face it we're Imperialists pure and simple. The elite look down on all of us as expendable chattel.
"Military men are dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns for foreign policy" Henry Kissinger
I'm not asking you to hate war, but to love peace? War, what is it good for, absolutely nothing!
Man! u r making me feel so guilty. I wish you would stop.
The only "terrorists" responsible for mass deaths amoung the civil population in Syria, are employed by the Syrian Government. The whole world knows this and your lies and misrepresentations are falling on deaf ears.
The Assad regime is doomed, and rightly so, the sooner Assad and his cronies are taken down, or taken out, the better
Its time Russia and China step up. We need to take care of our own and let other countries do their job. I, like everyone else, get angry when I hear this blatant misuse of force to control the people, but we have done enough its time to let the countries take care of theirselves.
TrustVerify:  Sounds like Orwell's 1984 novel is coming true.
He posts this same delusional rant at every opportunity that comes along...you can't stop him.  I guess he figures that nobody will notice it's cut and pasted if he changes a word here and there.  Just consider it wasted bandwidth and pay him no mind.
The real modern imperialists are the Chinese imperalists dogs from the country of the Peoples Republic of China!!! Those who forget the past are condemned in the future. USA s not an imperialist country, its the local country who don't know how to run their endemic politics, thats where the political troubles came from, and if you are an imperialists inutile, don't blame the USA! Blame your own irrationalistic views of imperialism!
Al Assad has no intention of honoring any 'protests' since he and his British trophy wife see this as as a threat to his dictatorship. The US is not involved in Syria for one reason: Obama has friends in the regime (who probably paid for his college tuition, or helped him get his 'birth certificate' from a Hawaiian hospital that did not exist when he supposedly was born as 'Barack Hussein Obama' even though he attended college as 'Barry Soetoro', a Malaysian national.) There is so much behind the scenes crap going on at this point that most of us will never know just what is really keeping the US out of Syria.
manthuin...You'd better be able to prove that President Obama has "friends in the regime who paid for his colleged education" in a court of law. Otherwise, you and your right wing BS Bashing is nothing but a pack of well-paid lies. Nice to see the Koch billionaires keep up the hostility and vitriol even on Sundays.
I barely even knew who the Koch Brothers where until I looked them up. Well guess what? They don't pay me to think nor write. I have just observed. So far the casualty's of these uprisings of the "Arab Spring" which is nothing more than a nice way of saying the taking over of targeted nations that will be turned from friendly, somewhat friendly, a friend of Israel to an Enemy of Israel.
Qaddafi was not lying when he said the Rebels where Al Qaeda Terrorists that where being trained in his country. These same " Rebels" who are actual Al Qaeda. How do I know it. Well that comes from the horse's mouth. I met a man here in Portland who is working envoy to the UN for his country. He is Muslim and we have talked.
There are three basic Elements vying for Power in the Region as he told me. One that is actually according to him garnering and forming a viable government to deal with the UN is " The Arab Brotherhood" which is the most organized, funded, and more peaceful of all the groups. Then you have Hamas, Al Qaeda. Of the last Al Qaeda is the most deadly according to this person. They will do anything necessary to gain control of a Nation.
Actually Hamas is more centered on other things then the other two. I found it interesting how they are all Muslim but each organization has quite different goals. Al Qaeda as this man told me feels like they are fighting a "Jihad" Holy War. So now we have Egypt that used to be friendly with Israel and now isn't. Assad Israel doesn't care for, but would rather deal with the devil they know rather than the one they don't. So it is all very interesting.
As the song says from a good band called "Rush" " All The Worlds A Stage!"
Soon someone behind the scenes is going to scream " Thats A Wrap!"
The banksters want WW3.  They want 6.5 billion people killed.  When the system collapses they will have the world hunting them, so they are going to do us first.  Iran is the fuse.  God bless to all.  Protect yourselves the best you can.
Lay off the crack pipe. You are proof it rots the mind!
My Anti Christ President has his own way of slaughtering his citizens using a military grade satellite as everyone got used to him having a power to smoother anyone in the most sicking ways...
Now that this mushrooming operation has produced a doctors note to dismiss everything along the thinnest and controlled surface that caused it, he simply turns my diaphragm off when I am trying to sleep creating what is the cruelest form of torture imaginable when you mind and body are exhausted but you need to stay awake to think about breathing because if I go to the doctor it will simply be assumed it is all in my head after they return the functions back to normal during the tests...
Well, probably the cruelest way to go Hu but there have been many that came before me and at the end of the day my thread was significant in the most extraordinary ways..
Must be Sunday that brings out all the loons to post their gibberish!?
Rich...Shouldn't you be asking McMommy for a diaper change about now? We've had about enough of your Freedom of Bashing the President Speech. It's your kind that seeks division most of all among Americans. You can't have your way and so you all go around asses dragging and bellowing to the hilltops about Big Bad Obama....since March 2009? Get a life you right wing Big Babies. You can't have YOUR WAY or the highway...so take the highway out of the US to North Korea and I'll guarantee you'll be in the North Korean military whether or not you want to. Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch...Middle Aged White Men who closet their bigotry since the 3rd month of a new presideny...Wow...and this is the Daycare Generation's finest? NOT.
"Now that this mushrooming operation has produced a doctors note to dismiss everything along the thinnest and controlled surface that caused it, he simply turns my diaphragm off when I am trying to sleep creating what is the cruelest form of torture imaginable when you mind and body are exhausted but you need to stay awake to think about breathing because if I go to the doctor it will simply be assumed it is all in my head after they return the functions back to normal during the tests..."
Wow!  Harkens back to the days of alien abductions and anal probes on the mothership!!!!
Hey Rich, did you do a lot of acid in high school?
Not much else can be said here.  Turkey, Jordon and other regional Islamic states/neighbors should intervene and confront Assad and stop waiting for the UN or NATO to do this for them.  It is spineless to see that the Arab League has yet to offer anything with the arm of enforcement behind it to get the Assad forces to stop the killing.  Then again, doing that may offer up ideas that might jeopardize their monopoly on power within their own borders.
One day, Assad won't have any people to rule. He'll have slaughtered the entire population while the world sits by and watches it on the 24-hour news cycle - an entire country slaughtered by this regime of butchers. What do you think history will say about the U-S, NATO, Arab League etc.? Cowards, cowards, cowards.
Well Jeff, what are you doing about it you little coward. Get your butt over there and protect those murderous musims from killing each other!!! and be quick about it!
Coward Coward Coward!!!
Hey Jeff heres a little something for you and others to see, if you dare watch it. and then ask are we any better?
Vietnam-american-holocaust in top documentary films
maybe you missed the report that 109 people mostly children and woman were brutally massacered....would you want the world to sit on the sides and watch this play itself out if it was happening to you....you must not have balls coward
If anyone bothered to get the real skinny on what's going on in Syria, you'd know that Assad refers to anyone who protests his policies as "terrorists". This is exactly what our American right wing terrorists do sans the massacres. What your righties in the US want is insularity so tightly compacted into a monolithical ideological ball with the string attached and held only by these right wing bullies.
They actually think there won't ever be blow back for their childish tantrums...Think again oh Grand Pubbahs of the Needle brained right.
Just give it up and leave or someone will make you leave in a body bag.
Revit Ray...That's the biggest problem all over the Middle East today....MEN..male tyrants who push their agenda on the entire population...these are nutjobs who long ago lost all mental stability. Their minds are so clogged with controlling everyone else they can't wake up a single day without a control freak plan of action.
These men are the last vestiges of total male autocracy and they know it. So they will exterminate an entire population if they must just to maintain their "kingdoms". Like that's never been done before...too bad whole civilizations were made extinct because of maniacal need to control.
The observers confirmed the use of artillery, which only Assad's forces have, but did not say how all the victims died.
Right, 'terrorists' who don't even have artillery, sure.
I would not dought this statement at all.
Just a quick question, Where is all the international outrage when NATO slaughters women and children in Afghanistan or Libya or when Israel slaughters civilians in Lebanon or Gaza? I'm just curious. I'm still looking for a good guy in the mid east and see only hypocrisy and double standards.
Thank God it wasn't the USA fault this time. Sorry for your loss,but when it's war anything goes. Many of our USA troops are killed daily defending you all butts.
Well this murdering bums father killed 50 or 60 thousand in his time, this slaughter house has been allowed to continue because Syria has no oil. We are more selective in stepping in to prevent crimes against humanity, if it don't benefit EXXON we are not so much into it...
It was the Mexica Drug Cartel that did it. Same M.O.
Hopefully France will call for a special meeting of the Friends of Syria. Assad must be removed
from power to save more lives of the Syrian people and the destruction of this country.  The Nations'
leaders are in my prayers.
"Facing mounting international outrage":  how long is "mounting"?  How many deaths is "mounting"?
How signs of horror have changed over time.  I guess the standards have changed, the world is wonderful the economy is great and we are all very happy.  Have we all become desensitized and stupid.  "they" must think so.
Europe needs to deal with this one. America has had enough for a while. they can send a small team and take Assad out.
Unfortunately, Assad is probably right...the insurgents did it.  What better way to play to the world press than to stage an act of utter brutality and blame Assad for the deed.
Can't we all just ge Kabooooooooooooooooooom!!!!!...........
