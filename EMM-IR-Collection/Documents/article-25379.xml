  <text>NATO leaders solidified plans Monday for an "irreversible transition" in Afghanistan, affirming their commitment to ending the deeply unpopular war in 2014 and voicing confidence in the ability of Afghan forces to take the lead for securing their country even sooner.
The alliance leaders formally agreed to a strategy that calls for a gradual exit of foreign combat troops as they held a second and final day of NATO meetings in Chicago, the hometown of U.S. President Barack Obama.
They declared in a summit communique that while NATO will maintain a significant presence in Afghanistan after 2014, "this will not be a combat mission."
The 28-member alliance agreed that Afghan security forces would take control of any combat next summer, with NATO sliding into a support role. Obama called the transition "the next milestone" in bringing the nearly 11-year long war to a close.
"This will be another step toward Afghans taking full lead for their security as agreed to by 2014," Obama said as he opened a meeting of NATO leaders and other countries that have participated in the war.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Afghans were already leading security operations in half the country and were on pace to meet next year's targets.
Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai was participating in Monday's meeting, as was Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, whose country will have a critical role in ensuring Afghanistan's stability after NATO troops leave.
At the NATO conference, leaders were also discussing how the international community would finance Afghan security forces after 2014. With none of the NATO countries having the stomach to pursue the war much longer, the only viable option is to support an Afghan army and police force capable of defending the country against the Taliban and its allies.
NATO estimates it will cost about $4.1 billion a year to finance the forces as their fight against the Taliban. The Afghan government will pay about $500 million of that, and the rest will come from donor countries, many of which are struggling with deficits and the spectre of recession.
Meanwhile, demonstrators were preparing to launch another day of major protests in Chicago. On the final day of the summit, commuters heading into the city found themselves navigating extra security and revised train and bus routes designed to dodge the summit zone.
Many downtown businesses told their employees to stay home during the second and final day of the summit because of traffic snarls and the possibility of more protests.
The weekend's protests have drawn thousands and called attention to everything from foreign policy to the economy, but have been mainly peaceful. The biggest conflict came late Sunday, when a group of protesters clashed with police at the end of a march.
On Monday, a group of demonstrators with the Occupy Chicago movement were planning to protest outside of Boeing Corp.'s headquarters. Officers were stationed there already Monday morning, and an orange barricade blocked off the building's entrances. Occupy claims the multi-billion-dollar aerospace company avoids paying taxes because it produces airplanes for the U.S. military.
More than two dozen Metra rail stations along a line that carries around 14,000 riders in from the southern suburbs on most weekdays were closed and stations and platforms were being patrolled by a larger contingent of law enforcement personnel and K-9 units. The Chicago Transit Authority was rerouting 24 buses through the summit zone.
But commuters who did brave their daily trip were finding something they were unaccustomed to: a seat on the train or bus. Early trains had plenty of room to stretch out, a sign workers were heeding warnings to stay home. Those who did commute were prohibited from bringing food or liquids — including coffee — and could only carry one bag.
"The no food or beverages — that's the only inconvenience," said Pete Dimaggio, 55, a credit manager. "Now I have to buy my lunch. They are making me spend money."
Monday's protests were expected to be far smaller than the weekend's events.
Andy Thayer, one of the main protest organizers, said he expected many demonstrators from out of town to leave Sunday night. After the Boeing demonstration, immigration rights activists were planning to travel to the small village of Crete, about 35 miles south of Chicago, where federal officials are considering building a nearly 800-bed detention facility for illegal immigrants slated for deportation.
Thayer said he still expected a strong contingent of protesters to show up for the Boeing protest and decried how city leaders and police officials have handled the protests.
"I am disgusted, particularly, with the upper echelon of our city," Thayer said.
On Sunday, several thousand protesters marched through downtown Chicago in one of the largest demonstrations the city has experienced in years, airing grievances about war, climate change, economic inequality and a range of other complaints.
But the diversity of opinions also sowed doubts about whether there were too many messages to be effective.
Some of the most enduring images of that protest were from a clash between a small group of demonstrators and a thick line of police who tried to keep them from the lakeside convention centre where President Barack Obama is hosting the NATO summit.
The protesters tried to move east toward the venue at McCormick Place with some hurling sticks and bottles at police. Officers responded by swinging their batons. The two sides were locked in a standoff for two hours, with police blocking the protesters' path and the crowd refusing to leave.
Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said 45 of those protesters were arrested. Police said four officers were hurt, including one who was stabbed in the leg. Some protesters had blood streaming down their faces.
Hundreds of protesters gathered late Sunday night near the Art Institute of Chicago as first lady Michelle Obama hosted a dinner for spouses of NATO leaders inside. At least 100 Chicago police officers in riot gear were also at the scene.
The protests, including relatively smaller demonstrations on Friday and Saturday, lacked the size and single message that shaped the last major protest moment in Chicago in 2006, when nearly half a million people filled the city's downtown to protest making it a felony to be an illegal immigrant.
