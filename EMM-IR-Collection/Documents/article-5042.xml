  <text>ATHENS - An elderly man shot himself in the head on Wednesday in Athens' central Syntagma Square, a focal point of anti-austerity protests, reportedly crying out that he did not want to leave his children in debt.
Police said the 77-year-old, whose identity was not revealed, killed himself outside the Syntagma metro station, around 100 metres (yards) from parliament, which for two years has been the main rallying point for demonstrations against government austerity measures.
Dozens of rush-hour commuters were crossing the capital's busiest square at the time, and according to media reports, eyewitnesses heard the man cry out that he did not want to leave his children in debt.
"It must have been around 8:45 a.m., I heard a bang but did not realize it was a gunshot," an elderly bystander told news website newsit.gr.
"Then I saw the man on the ground with people around him," he said.
An ambulance was called to the scene and the man, a retired pharmacist, was taken to a nearby hospital but he was already dead.
News reports said the man had left a suicide note in which he accused the government of leaving him in penury.
Police said they had opened an investigation into a motive. Another police source said the man had cancer.
Greece's government spokesman called the incident a "human tragedy" but noted that the exact circumstances had not been fully worked out.
"This is a human tragedy that must be respected," government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis told reporters.
"The exact circumstances are unknown," he said.
The deceased had been a pharmacist until 1994 when he sold his business, the head of the association of Athens pharmacists Costas Lourantos told the site.
"He had a daughter, and I remember he was a very respectable man," Lourantos said.
"Clearly, his dignity did not permit him to live under circumstances different to those he believed in," he said.
Depression and suicides have increased in Greece amid an economic crisis that has sent unemployment soaring and salaries and pensions plummeting, though the country's suicide rate is lower than the European average.
In 2009, it stood at three per 100,000 people or about a third lower than the European average, according to Eurostat.
Hundreds of thousands of Greeks have lost their jobs over the last year, and the unemployment rate currently tops one million, a quarter of the workforce.
A 38-year-old Albanian man killed himself on the island of Crete on Tuesday by jumping off his second-floor balcony. He had been unemployed for some time and faced financial hardship, local news reports said.
Several businessmen have also fatally shot themselves in the last few months as Greece sank into recession ever faster.
Authorities have been applying a tough economic overhaul since 2010, when the country was forced to appeal to the EU and the IMF for bailout loans after its borrowing costs hit the roof.
To secure loan payments, Greece has been forced to drastically cut state spending and has slashed civil servant salaries and pensions by up to 40 percent.
In February, a civil servant threatened to jump off the offices of the state housing organization OEK after the government said it would shut down the company. The woman was eventually persuaded to step back.
