  <text>UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan on Syria will address the UN General Assembly on Thursday about President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on rebels in Syria after a truce pledge.
Following a telephone call with Annan, General Assembly President Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser convened an informal meeting for 10 am Thursday for Annan to provide an update on the situation in Syria and the "progress of his mission," a spokesperson said.
She said Annan, a former UN secretary-general, would brief via videoconference.
Annan, tapped as envoy in February, has previously briefed the UN Security Council twice on his mission in Syria. He said Monday that Assad had agreed to "immediately" start pulling troops out of protest cities and complete a troop and heavy weapons withdrawal by April 10.
But fighting continues to rage in Syria despite the ceasefire plan brokered by Annan, with 18 people reported killed Wednesday. Over 9,000 people have died in the year-long conflict, according to UN estimates.
