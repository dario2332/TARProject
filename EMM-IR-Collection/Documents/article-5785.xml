  <text>Papademos in Cyprus as riots shake Athens
Papademos will meet with President Christofias and political leaders later.

The Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papdemos is heading to Cyprus, as protesters have clashed with riot police in Athens, hours after a pensioner shot himself dead outside parliament.
The 77-year-old man killed himself in the city's busy Syntagma Square on Wednesday morning.
Greek media reported he had left a suicide note accusing the government of cutting his pension to nothing.
Flowers have been laid at the spot where he died and tributes have been paid online.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the square outside parliament on Wednesday evening, the scene of many large protests in recent months.
Violence erupted, with petrol bombs hurled at police, who fired tear gas in response.
Depression and suicides are reported to have increased in Greece as the country introduces tough austerity measures to deal with huge debts.
Papademos issued a statement calling the death "tragic".
"In these difficult hours for our society we must all - the state and the citizens - support the people among us who are desperate."
Papademos will meet with President Christofias and political leaders later.
