  <text>At least four people have been killed and another twenty or so wounded during clashes in the Lebanese city of Tripoli.
At one point the Lebanese army intervened after a soldier was shot dead by a sniper.
The fighting underlines how tensions in Syria are threatening to spill over to its neighbours as the continued unrest there keeps claiming victims.
Renewed shelling was reported in Homs and Syrian troops are said to have shot dead seven civilians in a Sunni Muslim village west of the city of Hama.
