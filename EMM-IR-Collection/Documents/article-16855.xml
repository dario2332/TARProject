Police spokesman Binod Singh said the Agni Air plane crashed into a hill near Jomsom, a popular area for trekkers near the Annapurna mountain range.
"Seven men and four women have been killed," he said.
Mr Singh said there were six survivors, including two children, who had been rescued.
"The plane was about to land at Jomsom Airport. It hit a muddy slope and the plane is now buried in the side of the hill," he said.
Mr Singh said the aircraft had been carrying 18 passengers and three crew members.
Of those on board the plane, sixteen passengers were Indian and two Westerners, police official Nareswor Aryal said.
He could not immediately say where those two are from.
Jomsom Airport is a gateway to a popular trekking destination, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) north west of the capital, Kathmandu.
