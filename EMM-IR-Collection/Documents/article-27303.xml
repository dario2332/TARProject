  <text>The trial of two hotel staff accused of the murder of Michaela McAreavey is expected to hear its first witnesses today.
Avinash Treebhowoon, aged 29 and Sandip Mooneea, in his early 40's, are charged with the murder of the schoolteacher after she was strangled in her hotel room in January 2011.
The two men have pleaded not guilty.
Yesterday the McAreavey family appealed for privacy for the duration of the trial which is expected to last around two weeks.
