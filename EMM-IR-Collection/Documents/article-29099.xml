The Quebec government invited student groups Thursday for talks to end a three-month conflict over a planned hike in tuition fees after nearly 700 people were arrested overnight in the Canadian province.
No date was set for the meeting to which the four main student groups were invited, but it could talk place early next week, said the president of the FECQ student union, Leo Bureau-Blouin.
Many protesters are also now rallying against a special law passed last week requiring organizers to notify authorities eight hours ahead of public protests and suspending classes at strike-bound universities until mid-August.
All were issued with a fine exceeding $600 and released early Thursday, a police spokesman said.
It was the first time that law enforcement conducted such a large mass arrest in the French-speaking province.
About two hundred youths returned to the streets of Montreal on Thursday to express their anger at the law, this time wearing ninja and pirate costumes in a festive atmosphere.
The conflict escalated on Sunday with more than 300 overnight arrests after the passing of the controversial new law. On Tuesday, tens of thousands of demonstrators ignored their official itinerary as they marked the 100th day of the movement.
Rather than quelling the unrest, it appears to have made things worse for the embattled premier.
After nine years in power, Charest hoped an initially popular hike in fees might boost his dismal poll numbers, but months of building protests coupled with disapproval for the new law appear to have had the opposite effect.
A poll released on Tuesday by the Journal de Montreal found an 18% shift in favor of the students, compared to a poll taken 10 days earlier.
The QMI/Leger Marketing survey still showed the students trailing the government by eight points on the central question of who respondents supported, but the momentum has clearly turned.
