  <text>BEIRUT, Lebanon &amp;mdash; Faced with mounting criticism over attacks that killed more than 90 villagers, Syria said Sunday that anti-government terrorists, and not Syrian forces, were responsible for the massacre.
The bodies of a man and a girl, who villagers said were among those killed by government security forces on Friday, were placed on the vehicle of United Nations observers upon their arrival in Houla on Saturday.

Jihad Makdissi, the spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry, denied any responsibility by the Syrian government for the massacre of over 90 civilians in Houla.
"We completely deny responsibility for this terrorist massacre against our people," the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Jihad Makdissi, told reporters Sunday during a news conference. Among the dead were at least 32 children under the age of 10.
The Syrian government, he told reporters, was being subjected to a "tsunami of lies."
"Women, children and old men were shot dead," Mr. Makdissi said, according to Reuters. "This is not the hallmark of the heroic Syrian army."
He said that the government of President Bashar al-Assad would investigate and that a report was expected in about three days.
Mr. Makdissi's comments came a day after opposition groups reported that Syrian soldiers and pro-government fighters had stormed Houla, a rebel-controlled village near the restive city of Homs, killing families in their homes late at night.
United Nations monitors visiting the village counted at least 92 bodies, including at least 32 children, and found spent tank shells, which they cited as evidence that the Syrian military had violated its part of a truce in firing heavy artillery at civilians. A United Nations statement said the observers confirmed that "artillery and tank shells were fired at a residential neighborhood."
Amateur videos said to be taken in the aftermath showed row after row of victims, many of them small children with what appeared to be bullet holes in their temples. Other videos showed gruesome shrapnel wounds caused by what activists said was a barrage of shelling that started Friday in response to demonstrations after the weekly prayer service and that continued Saturday.
The massacre prompted new questions about the continued effectiveness of the truce just as Kofi Annan, the architect of the truce, was on his way to Damascus. The opposition has criticized the truce, and the United Nations peacekeepers who came with it, as ineffective. There are 271 unarmed military observers on the ground in Syria, nearly the entire contingent of 300 approved by the Security Council, as well as numerous civilian workers.
International officials continued to express outrage about the attack, and the British government said Sunday that Syria's charg&amp;eacute; d'affaires had been called to a meeting Monday with the Foreign Office so Britain can stress its "condemnation" over the incident.
"Following the horrifying massacre of innocent civilians in Houla, the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, has instructed that the Syrian charg&amp;eacute; d'affaires be summoned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office," the British government said in a statement.
Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, and Mr. Annan, his predecessor and envoy to Syria called the attack an "appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms." They called on Syria to stop using heavy weapons in population centers and for all sides to cease violence.
The a White House official said the attack was "a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality."
Gory images posted online &amp;mdash; particularly the scene of rows of dead children smeared with blood &amp;mdash; prompted an emotional outpouring of antigovernment demonstrations across Syria and calls for sectarian revenge.
Activists said that much of the slaughter had been carried out by pro-government thugs, or "shabiha," from the area. Houla is a Sunni Muslim town, while three villages around it are mostly Alawite, the religion of Mr. Assad and whose adherents are the core of his security forces. A fourth village is Shiite Muslim.
A man in a black knitted mask who appeared on one YouTube video, for example, said it was time "to prepare for vengeance against this awful sectarian regime."
The rebel Free Syrian Army, the loose federation of armed militias across the country, issued a statement saying it was no longer committed to the United Nations truce because the plan was merely buying time for the government to kill civilians and destroy cities and villages.
"We won't allow truce after truce, which prolongs the crisis for years," the statement said.
The Syrian government blamed "terrorists," its catchall phrase for the opposition, for killing the civilians.
