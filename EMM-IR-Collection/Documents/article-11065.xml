ANDERS Behring Breivik, who has confessed to killing 77 people in terror attacks, makes far-Right salute as court opens.
The right-wing fanatic responsible for the bomb-and-shooting massacre that   killed 77 people in Norway has admitted to the "acts" in court but pleaded   not guilty to criminal charges, saying he was acting in self-defence.

Anders Breivik rejected the authority of the court as he went on trial for the   July 22 attacks.
Dressed in a dark suit and sporting a thin beard along his jawline, Breivik   smiled as a guard removed his handcuffs in the crowded court room. The   33-year-old then made a closed-fist, far-right salute, before shaking hands   with prosecutors and court officials.
"I don't recognise Norwegian courts because you get your mandate from the   Norwegian political parties who support multiculturalism," Breivik said   in his first comments to the court.
He remained stone-faced and motionless as prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh read his   indictment on terror and premeditated murder charges, with descriptions of   how each victim died. Eight were killed in a bombing in Oslo's government   district and 69 in a shooting massacre at the Labor Party's youth camp on   Utoya island outside the capital.
"I admit to the acts, but not criminal guilt," he told the court,   and said he had acted in self-defence.
Breivik also said he does not recognise the authority of Judge Wenche   Elisabeth Arntzen, because he said she is friends with the sister of former   Norwegian Prime Minister and Labor Party leader Gro Harlem Brundtland.
The anti-Muslim militant described himself as a writer, currently working from   prison, when asked by the judge for his employment status.
Breivik has said the attacks were necessary to protect Norway from being taken   over by Muslims. He claims he targeted the government headquarters in Oslo   and the youth camp to strike against the left-leaning political forces he   blames for allowing immigration in Norway.
While there is a principle of preventive self-defence in Norwegian law, it   does not apply to Breivik's case, said Jarl Borgvin Doerre, a legal expert,   who has written a book about the concept.
"It is obvious that it has nothing to do with preventive self-defence,"   he said.
The key issue to be resolved during the 10-week trial is the state of   Breivik's mental health, which will decide whether he is sent to prison or   to psychiatric care.
If deemed mentally competent, he would face a maximum prison sentence of 21   years or an alternate custody arrangement under which the sentence is   prolonged for as long as an inmate is deemed a danger to society.
Police sealed off the streets around the court building, where journalists,   survivors and relatives of victims watched the proceedings in a 200-seat   courtroom built specifically for the trial.
Thick glass partitions were put up to separate the defendant from victims and   their families, many of whom are worried that Breivik will use the trial to   promote his extremist political ideology. In a manifesto he published online   before the attacks, Breivik wrote that "patriotic resistance fighters"   should use trials "as a platform to further our cause."
Norway television will broadcast parts of the trial, but it is not allowed to   show Breivik's testimony.
He had told investigators he is a resistance fighter in a far-right militant   group modelled after the Knights Templar - a Christian order that fought   during the crusades - but police have found no trace of the organisation and   say he acted alone.
"In our opinion such a network does not exist," prosecutor Svein   Holden told the court.
Anxious to prove he is not insane, he has called right-wing extremists and   radical Islamists to give evidence during the trial, to show that there are   others who share his view of clashing civilisations.
Breivik surrendered to police 1 hour and 20 minutes after he arrived on Utoya.   The police response was slowed by a series of mishaps, including the lack of   an operating police helicopter and the breakdown of an overloaded boat   carrying a commando team to the island.
