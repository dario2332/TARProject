  <text>DAMASCUS, Syria, April 10 (UPI) -- The deadline for a U.N.-brokered peace plan in Syria passed Tuesday morning with no signs the Assad regime was complying with the deal.
Fighting was still reported in several cities, opposition groups said, as U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan was to visit refugee camps in southern Turkey a day after Syrian forces fired across the border near a refugee camp, killed two Syrian refugees and wounded at least 23 other people, including a Turkish police officer and another Turkish citizen, and as Lebanon called on Syria to investigate the shooting death of a cameraman who was reporting on the unrest from the Lebanese side of the border.
Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi did not say if Annan would visit the camp near the southern Turkish town of Kilis, where the shooting occurred, the Turkish newspaper Today's Zaman reported Tuesday.
Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph Lieberman, Ind-Conn., were also to meet with refugees in Turkey Tuesday.
Nearly 3,000 Syrians fled to Turkey last week, pushing the total number of refugees to nearly 25,000, Turkish officials said.
A senior Turkish Foreign Ministry official told the newspaper Syria's ranking diplomat was summoned and given a harsh message about Turkey's anger regarding the episode.
The ministry called the gunfire a "grave" development.
The government of Syrian President Bashar Assad had no immediate comment.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Defense Minister Ismet Yılmaz both said last week a military option had not been ruled out in resolving the Syrian crisis.
Turkey was once one of Assad's closest allies. But Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan became an early and harsh critic of Syria's crackdown on protesters last year.
The opposition Syrian National Council umbrella group said it was ready to respect a cease-fire.
"The opposition, including the Free Syrian Army, says it will comply if the regime does," council executive committee member Bassma Kodmani was quoted by The New York Times as saying.
The Syrian opposition groups were ready to put a cease-fire into effect Tuesday and not wait until Thursday, she said.
But she said the regime's actions were "clearly not a sign of their intention to cooperate in good faith."
At least 160 people were killed in Syria Monday, as forces loyal to Assad shelled buildings and shot at residents of rebellious cities, opposition groups said.
Damascus said Sunday it would not honor the cease-fire worked out by Annan until it received written guarantees from rebel groups that they would stop fighting and written assurances from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey they would "stop funding and arming terrorist groups." Syria accuses the countries of funding and arming the rebels.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem was to meet his Russian counterpart in Moscow Tuesday.
Moscow, which publicly endorsed the truce, is a key Syrian supporter.
