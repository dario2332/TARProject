The university indicated on its website that the gunman - described as a white male in a maroon hooded sweatshirt and grey sweatpants - might still be at large, as the 31,000-student campus was put under lockdown.
"The status of the shooter is unknown," it said. "The campus community should continue to shelter in place and visitors should not come to campus."
UPDATE: The school has advised there is no longer an "active threat" from the gunman and that students were to resume "normal activities".
The school said the police officer, a member of Virginia Tech's own security force, was shot and killed during a "routine traffic stop" in a car park near the McComas swimming pool and athletics building.
"Witnesses reported to police the shooter fled on foot heading toward the Cage, a parking lot near Duck Pond Drive," it added.
"At that parking lot, a second person was found. That person is also deceased."
Julia Fleming, a Virginia Tech freshman, told WDBJ-TV that she did not hear any shots being fired, but saw the officer covered in blood.
"I guess the officer didn't make it because they covered him with sheets," the visibly shaken student said.

Collegiate Times, a student newspaper at Virginia Tech, earlier tweeted that students had been moved to a secure location inside the Squires student centre on campus.
Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Virginia, was the scene of the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in US history in April 2007 when an English major, Seung-Hui Cho, 23, killed 32 people before taking his own life.
Twenty-five others were wounded.
With the drama unfolding today, Twitter was flooded with tweets from people after word of the shooting spread across the internet.
