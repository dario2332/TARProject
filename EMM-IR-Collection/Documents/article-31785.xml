  <text>William Hague said he was 'absolutely sickened' by the massacre of at least 108 people in Houla, Syria
President Bashar Assad's regime was the focus of mounting uproar and condemnation for the Houla massacre, despite having denied being behind the slaughter.
Its claim that the bloodshed was caused by anti-government forces was dismissed by the international community, including Foreign Secretary William Hague.
After an emergency meeting on Sunday night, the UN Security Council said the Syrian government was responsible for artillery and tank shelling of residential areas. It also condemned "the killing of civilians by shooting at close range and by severe physical abuse", adding that the "outrageous use of force" violated international law.
At least 108 people, including 49 children and 34 women, died in Friday's attacks, according to UN monitors.
Mr Hague said earlier that he was "absolutely sickened" by the massacre. The Syrian charge d'affaires is to be summoned to the Foreign Office to hear the Government's condemnation.
"It is a familiar tactic of the Assad regime to blame others for what's happening in their country to try to get out of responsibility for the scale of the destruction," Mr Hague said. "We are absolutely sickened in the British Government and across the international community by what we've seen over the last few days, in particular about the deaths of more than 100 unarmed men, women and children."
He said they were "more statistics" to add to a "huge total" that demonstrate the "brutality" of the regime, adding that the deaths "illuminate the type of tyranny that the people in Syria have been experiencing".
Mr Hague is due to hold talks about the international community's response with Russia's foreign minister in Moscow.
Russia and China have been the principal opponents of stronger action against the Syrian regime by the UN. "It isn't in the interests of Russia, it's not in anyone's interests, for Syria to descend into an even bloodier situation and into a full-scale civil war and that's now the danger," Mr Hague added.
