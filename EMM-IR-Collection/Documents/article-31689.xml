The UN Security Council has condemned the Syrian regime over the massacre of more than 100 people in the town of Houla.A statement agreed by the 15-nation council said the attacks "involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighbourhood" and again demanded that President Bashar al-Assad withdraw heavy weapons from Syrian towns."The members of the Security Council reiterated that all violence in all its forms by all parties must cease," it said. "Those responsible for acts of violence must be held accountable."Britain's UN ambassador Mark Lyall-Grant said that the council statement, while important, was not enough."Over the next two days, the Security Council will be meeting again to discuss in more detail what steps need to be taken," he said.The Syrian Government has denied responsibility for the massacre, and Syria's ambassador to the UN said the meeting had been told a "tsunami of lies"."Women, children and old men were shot dead. This is not the hallmark of the heroic Syrian army," foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said."We categorically deny that Syrian Government forces are responsible for this massacre, and we condemn in very strong terms this terrorist and clearly criminal massacre of Syrian youths, girls and and old men."We are sorry that some people make hasty judgments about events."Instead, the government blamed "terrorists" for the deaths."We have set up a military and legal committee to investigate," Mr Makdissi said."The results will emerge within days."British foreign secretary William Hague said time was running out for the regime to stop violence against its people."It is a familiar tactic of the Assad regime to blame others for what is happening in their country, to try to get out of responsibility for the scale of death and destruction," he said."We are absolutely sickened in the British Government and across the international community by what we�ve seen over the last couple of days, in particular the deaths of more than a hundred unarmed men, women and children."UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan is to brief the Security Council on the Syria crisis at a new meeting on Wednesday.Witnessing horrorWitnesses in Houla said men were shot in the streets and women and children were stabbed in their homes during the attacks on Friday and Saturday.Many of the child victims were stabbed to death in their homes after an artillery bombardment.Amateur videos posted on YouTube showed horrifying images of dead children, with at least one child's head partly blown away.Another video posted on YouTube showed a mass grave filled with bodies wrapped in white sheets.The rebel Free Syrian Army warned that unless the international community took concrete action, it would no longer be bound by the UN-backed ceasefire that was supposed to start last month.Sanctions pushAustralia is pushing for stronger UN action on Syria, including tougher sanctions.Foreign Minister Bob Carr has asked Australia's ambassador to the UN to start discussing tougher sanctions against Syria with other governments.Senator Carr described the Houla massacre as hideous, and said no effort should be spared in bringing those responsible to justice. He also said those responsible for the killings could be referred to the International Criminal Court."I'd like to see sanctions strengthened, all of us would, but we want to stop short of hurting the Syrian people, " he said.
