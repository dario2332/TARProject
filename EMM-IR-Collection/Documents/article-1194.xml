"We are on the verge of a significant breakthrough in the AIDS  response," said Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS.
"New HIV infections continue to fall and more people than ever  are starting treatment."
About half of those eligible for treatment are now receiving it,  with the most dramatic improvement in access seen in sub-Saharan  Africa, which recorded a 20 per cent jump in people undergoing  treatment between 2009 and 2010.
As a result of better access to healthcare, the number of  AIDS-related deaths were also falling, said UNAIDS, the UN agency  spearheading the international campaign against the disease.
In 2010, 1.8 million deaths were linked to AIDS, down from a  peak of 2.2 million last seen in 2006.
"An estimated 700,000 AIDS-related deaths were estimated to have  been averted in 2010 alone," added the UN agency.
Not only is treatment helping to prevent new AIDS-related deaths  but it is also contributing to a drop in new HIV infections.
Patients undergoing care were less likely to infect others, as  prevention programs coupled with treatments were proving effective.
Modelling data suggests that "the number of new HIV infections  is 30 to 50 per cent lower now than it would have been in the  absence of universal access to treatment for eligible people living  with HIV."
In Namibia for instance, where treatment access reached an  all-time high of 90 per cent and condom use rose to 75 per cent  among men, the combined impact contributed to a 60 per cent drop in  new infections by 2010, noted UNAIDS.
The UN agency added that the full preventive impact of treatment  was likely to be seen in the next five years, as more countries  reach high levels of treatment coverage.
"The massive increases in the numbers of people receiving  treatment in South Africa between 2009 and 2010, for example, are  likely to be reflected in substantially fewer new infections in the  near future," it said.
UNAIDS assessed that even if the AIDS epidemic is not over, "the  end may be in sight if countries invest smartly."
"In the next five years, smart investments can propel the AIDS  response towards achieving the vision of zero new HIV infections,  zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths," it said.
However, the turning point is coming at a time when  industrialised nations' public budgets are being squeezed and  translating to less international funding for the AIDS response.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres urged governments to  keep up their funding.
"Never, in more than a decade of treating people living with  HIV/AIDS, have we been at such a promising moment to really turn  this epidemic around," said Tido von Schoen-Angerer, who heads  MSF's access campaign.
"Governments in some of the hardest hit countries want to act on  the science, seize this moment and reverse the AIDS epidemic. But  this means nothing if there's no money to make it happen."
