UN condemns Syria over massacre
Syrian foreign ministry denies Houla killings
An international response to the escalating violence in Syria has been conveniently 'blocked,' says chief correspondent Paul McGeough.
DIPLOMATIC pressure has been   brought to bear on Moscow and Damascus after the United Nations Security Council condemned the use of artillery in a massacre in which at least 108 people, including 49 children,  were killed and 300 injured.
The UN special envoy to Syria, Kofi Annan, arrived in Damascus overnight and met  Syrian officials. However, the UN peace plan for which Mr Annan has responsibility was in disarray even before he arrived.
As violence continued in Syria yesterday, with a further 30 reported killed in Hama, the Houla massacre has already stretched the credibility of the UN observer mission. The Free Syrian Army issued a statement saying that the ceasefire deal was  ''going to hell'' and that concerted international intervention was required.

Mr Annan's mission was also complicated by the Syrian government. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jihad Makdissi, said the government ''categorically denies the government forces' responsibility for the massacre''.
He  denounced the ''tsunami of lies'' that he said wrongly put the blame on Syrian forces.
The Security Council said the ''outrageous use of force against [the] civilian population'' is a violation of a UN peace plan.  It called on the government and its opponents to end violence, the UN said.

The statement was approved after a lengthy discussion with Syria's ally Russia, which originally blocked a joint statement.
Russia, a staunch supporter and supplier of arms to the regime of the President, Bashar al-Assad, insisted explicit references to Syrian armed forces being responsible for the latest bloodshed be dropped.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said both sides in the Syrian conflict ''had a hand'' in the deaths.
''Both sides have obviously had a hand in the deaths of innocent people, including several dozen women and children. This area is controlled by the rebels, but it is also surrounded by the governmental troops,'' Mr Lavrov said after talks with the visiting British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, in Moscow.
He said there was no doubt that government forces had used artillery and tanks to shell Houla, or that many of the bodies were found with wounds indicating they had been hit at close range or tortured.
''The guilt has to be determined objectively,'' Mr Lavrov said. ''No one is saying that the government is not guilty, and no one is saying that the armed militants are not guilty.''
Mr Lavrov and Mr Hague both called for greater efforts to implement a peace plan put forward by Mr Annan, which calls on both sides to respect a ceasefire.
Before the talks, Mr Hague had issued an ultimatum to Russia to intervene in the Syrian crisis before it was too late, warning the massacre in Houla had taken the country to the brink of civil war.
''It's right, as Sergey Lavrov has just done, to call on all parties to cease violence, and we are not arguing that all violence in Syria is the responsibility of the Assad regime, although it has the primary responsibility for such violence,'' Mr Hague said.
Mr Lavrov added that ''we don't support the Syrian government, we support Kofi Annan's plan''.
Speaking from Damascus, Mr Annan said those responsible for ''brutal crimes'' in Houla must be ''held accountable.''
In Australia, the Foreign Affairs Minister, Bob Carr, called in the Syrian envoy    to express the government's anger over the massacre.
As the groundswell of Western condemnation grew Syria blamed ''terrorists'' for the incident.
''Women, children and old men were shot dead. This is not the hallmark of the heroic Syrian army,'' a Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
The US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, focused on what she described as the ''vicious assault that involved a regime artillery and tank barrage on a residential neighbourhood''.
''Those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account. And the United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on Assad and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end.''
At the G8 summit in Chicago, the US President, Barack Obama, suggested that Yemen, where the former president  Ali Abdullah Saleh was eased out of power through talks, could provide a model for Syria if the Annan plan fails. The French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, accused  Syria  of committing ''new massacres''.
