  <text>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Trayvon Martin's autopsy shows evidence of marijuana in his urine and blood.
The autopsy was among a large amount of evidence released by prosecutors on Thursday as part of the second-degree murder case against the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot him in February.
Other documents include a photograph that shows suspect George Zimmerman with a bloody nose. Zimmerman has claimed self-defense and said he only fired because the unarmed teenager attacked him. He has pleaded not guilty.
A police report says Martin had $40.15, Skittles candy, a red lighter, headphones and a photo pin in his pocket. He had been shot once in the chest and was pronounced dead at the scene.
