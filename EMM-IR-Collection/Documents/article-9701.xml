Syrian troops shelled rebel neighborhoods of Homs on Saturday as the U.N. Security Council prepared to vote on a Western-drafted resolution that would dispatch observers to monitor a truce now in its third day.
Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad shelled the Jurat al-Shayah and al-Qarabis districts of the city for around an hour during the morning, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, without giving any immediate word on any casualties.
Further south, in the town of Dmeir, outside Damascus, security forces opened fire on a car, killing one civilian and wounding two, the Britain-based watchdog said.
The death came after six civilians were killed on Friday as tens of thousands marched across Syria, heeding calls by the opposition to take advantage of the U.N.-backed truce that went into force at dawn on Thursday.
The United States called for a vote at the U.N. Security Council after a second day of wrangling with Russia over security guarantees for the first 30 unarmed military monitors who U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan wants in Syria early next week.
Russia also opposed the council demanding that Assad’s regime carry out a promise to withdraw troops and heavy weapons from towns and cities.
Russia’s U.N. ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he was not “completely satisfied” with the talks held at the U.N. on Friday. Russia and China have vetoed two previous Security Council resolutions on Syria.
Negotiations had been “rather difficult,” he said, while insisting that Russia wants a vote on Saturday that allows the Syrian ceasefire to be “reinforced.”
Neither the United States nor its allies are certain that the resolution would escape a new veto.
“It would be wise not to make predictions,” said U.S. ambassador Susan Rice.
“There was a negotiation, there is not yet an agreement,” France’s U.N. ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters. “It’s very tough, but there will be a vote tomorrow in any case.”
A Security Council diplomat said: “A veto cannot be ruled out. It would be catastrophic for Syria if it happens.”
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Assad’s ceasefire declaration was insincere and renewed a call for the creation of aid passages, without saying how these could be protected.
