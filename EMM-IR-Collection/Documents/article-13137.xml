  <text>On Thursday, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stepped up the pressure on Damascus, saying the UN Security Council should consider adopting a sanctions resolution that is capable of being enforced if Syria does not permit an adequate monitoring mission.
The French government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, who faces the first round of a tough re-election battle on Sunday, has long led calls for Assad to step aside. It has also said it would support military action if there was a UN mandate, something that remains unlikely given Moscow and Beijing's opposition to intervention.
"If in a few days or weeks it doesn't work then we will go to a next phase and a new resolution that has sanctions and intervention, as Mrs. Clinton indicated," Juppe said.
Clinton said a resolution proposing sanctions would probably be vetoed now, but that world powers should push for a Chapter 7 sanctions resolution, including travel, financial sanctions, an arms embargo, and ultimately military intervention.
French Socialist presidential frontrunner Francois Hollande said on Friday he would send troops to Syria in the event of a UN mandate for military intervention.
"If it (military intervention) is done in the framework of the UN, then we will take part in this intervention," Hollande, who is comfortably ahead of Sarkozy for a May 6 poll runoff, told Europe 1 radio.
Friday is the last day that candidates can campaign before Sunday's first-round election, in which four new polls show Hollande to be gaining over the president.
"The thing about Hollande is he is always playing catch-up. It's very easy to say we will support a military intervention if there is a resolution, but the problem is knowing whether that is possible," Juppe said of Hollande's remarks.
Hollande, who was an adviser to the last Socialist government in France that took the decision to intervene in Afghanistan in 2001, has similar foreign policy objectives to incumbent Sarkozy. However, Hollande has faced criticism after announcing plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2012, a year earlier than scheduled.
