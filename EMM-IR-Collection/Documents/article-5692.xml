  <text>The Syrian government is pulling troops and hardware out of a number of areas, of which it has informed the UN special envoy Kofi Annan.
Mr. Annan's spokesman Ahmed Fawzi said in Geneva on Thursday that by April 10, government troops were to be withdrawn from major cities, upon which a full ceasefire would be enacted within 48 hours under a peace plan put forward by Kofi Annan.
The plan also provides for the deployment of an international ceasefire monitoring mission and the beginning of an all-inclusive internal dialogue on Syria's future.
