  <text>The UN says it is sending an advance team to Syria to discuss the deployment of observers to monitor a ceasefire, even as rebels report more shelling in Syrian cities.
The Syrian regime has agreed to withdraw its troops from populated areas by April 10 in compliance with the peace plan proposed by international envoy Kofi Annan, the latest effort to end a year of bloodshed stemming from an uprising against president Bashar al-Assad's rule.
The team from the United Nations' peacekeeping department will arrive in Damascus in the next two days, Mr Annan's spokesman said in Geneva.
But Syrian opposition figures as well as Western governments have already made it clear they are not convinced that Mr Assad, who has failed to honour previous commitments, would keep his word this time.
Already, opposition activists say fierce fighting is continuing despite the ceasefire pledge.
Activists accuse Syrian troops of shelling two cities on Tuesday in a campaign to weaken forces fighting the Assad regime, before the ceasefire deadline is reached.
Rebel fighters also kept up their attacks, killing three soldiers in separate actions in northern Syria, activists said.
In the rebel hotspot city of Homs, opposition activist Waleed al-Fares said targets in the city were coming under government shelling.
Another activist, Mortadha al-Rashid, from Damascus, said the western border town of Zabadani was also taking a pounding.
"The regime shows no signs of stopping. There are people being shelled in Zabadani right now," Mr Rashid said.
"Where are Kofi Annan's words? Because we have never seen them on the streets."
In violence elsewhere, rebel fighters killed one soldier in a clash in northern Idlib province, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitor  which collates reports from inside Syria.
Armed men also attacked the home of a military director of logistics in Aleppo, killing two guards, the Observatory said.
The Syrian state news agency SANA said 10 soldiers and policemen were buried with honours on Monday.
Accounts of the violence can be difficult to verify because  the Syrian government restricts access to Western journalists.
But the United Nations estimates Mr Assad's forces have killed more than 9,000 people in the past year, while the government says about 3,000 security personnel have been killed by what it describes as foreign-backed gangs of terrorists.
SANA says Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moualem has met the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Jakob Kellenberger, and agreed on "a cooperation mechanism" for humanitarian assistance.
It made no mention of the ICRC's call for a daily two-hour ceasefire to provide aid and evacuate the wounded.
The opposition Syrian National Council has endorsed Mr Annan's six-point peace plan but made no official comment on the April 10 ceasefire target.
Rebels of the Free Syrian Army have said they will stop shooting if tanks and artillery withdraw from cities.
