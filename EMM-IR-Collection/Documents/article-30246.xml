  <text>Army tanks were deployed on Friday in Syria's second city Aleppo for the first time since an uprising against the regime erupted 14 months ago, a monitoring group said.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the tanks rumbled through the Kalasse and Bustan al-Kasr neighborhoods of the northern city, where thousands of people attended a funeral.
The Observatory reported earlier that a young man was killed in Aleppo when troops fired with live rounds and tear gas on protesters in the city, where 12 massive anti-regime rallies took place on Friday.
"Long live Syria! Down with Assad!" demonstrators chanted at the funeral, shortly after tens of thousands of people took to the streets to demand the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad's regime, according to the watchdog.
"They are the most important protests in Aleppo" since the uprising started in March 2011, said the Observatory's head Rami Abdel Rahman.
More than 12,600 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against Assad's rule broke out in March last year, including nearly 1,500 since the UN-backed truce took effect, according to figures from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.-AFP/NOW Lebanon
